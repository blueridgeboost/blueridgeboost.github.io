      <title>Kids&#39; Coding Course | Blue Ridge Boost</title>
      <link>https://blueridgeboost.com/classes/Kids-Coding-Course/</link>

      <guid>https://blueridgeboost.com/classes/Kids-Coding-Course/</guid>
      <description>Students learn sequencing, repetition, problem-solving, and conditional logic while developing practical coding skills. The course employs a hands-on, gamified approach that gradually increases in complexity, allowing each child to advance at their own speed. By the end, students can create sophisticated programs, having built a strong foundation in coding and computational thinking.&#xA;We start to learn fundamental coding concepts by helping a beaver build a dam! The learning continues with learning to code games in Scratch.</description>
