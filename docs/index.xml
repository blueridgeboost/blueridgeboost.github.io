      <description>History of Blue Ridge Boost During the COVID-19 pandemic, I spent significant time teaching and helping my children learn and discovered that I greatly enjoy teaching young students. As a result, I quit my Ph.D. program in Computer Science to pursue a degree in teaching at the University of Virginia, which I completed in May 2022.
During the lockdown, my children tried a variety of challenging and exciting classes. Still, however good the instructors were, they could not compensate for the lack of face-to-face interaction.</description>
