      <description>Students ages six to ten learn fundamental coding concepts by helping a beaver build a dam on instructor-provided Chromebooks. First, students learn to code using simple commands to move left, right and drop logs. Next, students learn to code repetition using repeat loops executed a fixed or a variable number of times. In the second part of the course, students learn to code using conditional loops. In the third part of the course, students learn to code using conditional statements with simple and compound conditions.</description>

      <guid>https://blueridgeboost.com/class/coding/tweens-coffee-script/</guid>
      <description>Students learn fundamental coding concepts using Coffee Script, a beginner-friendly text-based coding language. The young coders use an attractive graphical interface to generate text by pressing buttons on instructor-provided Chromebooks. Some previous experience typing is helpful but not necessary.
Classes run in four-week sessions. Each class is 50 minutes long. We adjust classes to the pace of each student. Students typically need between ten to fourteen sessions to complete the course, depending on age and previous coding experience.</description>

      <description>During the COVID-19 pandemic, I spent a significant amount of time teaching and helping my children learn and discovered that I greatly enjoy teaching young students. As a result, I quit my Ph.D. program in Computer Science to pursue a degree in teaching at the University of Virginia and launched Blue Ridge Boost.
During the lockdown, Maxwell and Dorina tried a variety of challenging and exciting classes from the Center for Talented Youth at John Hopkins and The Art Of Problem Solving.</description>
