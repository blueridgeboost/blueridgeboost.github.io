      <description>History of Blue Ridge Boost During the COVID-19 pandemic, I spent a significant amount of time teaching and helping my children learn, and I discovered that I greatly enjoy teaching young students. This newfound passion led me to quit my Ph.D. program in Computer Science to pursue a degree in teaching at the University of Virginia, and I subsequently launched Blue Ridge Boost.&#xA;During the lockdown, Maxwell and Dorina enrolled in various challenging and exciting classes offered by the Center for Talented Youth at Johns Hopkins and The Art of Problem Solving.</description>
