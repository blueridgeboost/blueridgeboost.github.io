      <description>In the Space Race Camp, campers meet “VEX,” the 123 Robot through a fun and interactive story and establish a set of rules and practices for working with the robot. Then, campers imagine their robot as a Mars rover and complete several missions including coding their robot to collect samples and return them to base camp for delivering to Earth. Then, campers will use the Eye Sensor to detect objects and clear the landing area for future missions. In the afternoons, the campers use the Art Ring and craft materials to transform the Vex123 robot into a variety of animals.</description>

      <description>History of Blue Ridge Boost During the COVID-19 pandemic, I spent a significant amount of time teaching and helping my children learn, and I discovered that I greatly enjoy teaching young students. This newfound passion led me to quit my Ph.D. program in Computer Science to pursue a degree in teaching at the University of Virginia, and I subsequently launched Blue Ridge Boost.&#xA;During the lockdown, Maxwell and Dorina enrolled in various challenging and exciting classes offered by the Center for Talented Youth at Johns Hopkins and The Art of Problem Solving.</description>
