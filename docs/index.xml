      <description>At Blue Ridge Boost, we are committed to making our classes affordable and encouraging the participation of underrepresented groups in the field of computer science. While we strive to provide a high-quality educational experience at the lowest price, we are aware that our classes and camps are too expensive for some of the children interested in computing. For that reason, we created three scholarship funds in remembrance of dear friends, three siblings that, unconditionally, loved each other and positively impacted everyone they came in contact with.</description>
