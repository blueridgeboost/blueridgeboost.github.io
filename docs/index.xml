Coding games is a fun and interactive way for kids to learn the foundations of computer programming. The class uses a project-based approach to introduce essential coding concepts through building a series of playable games. Each one teaches an important programming technique or concept. Students first follow steps to create a basic version, then are challenged to extend it on their own. This learn-by-doing method helps cement understanding through hands-on application.</description></item><item><title>Second Grade Coding and Math Classes in Charlottesville | Blue Ridge Boost</title><link>https://blueridgeboost.com/class/second-grade/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blueridgeboost.com/class/second-grade/</guid><description>Classes run from January 3 to February 25.
