        <p>The class is structured into twelve lessons.</p>
        <p><b>Lesson 1 - Introduction to AI and Ethical Considerations</b> provides an overview of artificial intelligence (AI) and its practical applications. It explains that AI is about making machines think and act like humans and gives examples such as voice recognition and self-driving cars. The lesson also explores the benefits and drawbacks of AI. It emphasizes the need for responsible AI usage, as AI lacks human emotions and common sense. The lesson highlights the advantages of AI, such as increased efficiency and personalized services, but also acknowledges concerns like job automation and privacy. Students learn about the importance of ethical considerations when using AI.</p>
        <p><b>Lesson 2 - Using AI - Language Model</b> introduces generative AI and AI language models. These models learn from large amounts of text data and can generate new text based on what they have learned. An example is GPT-3, which can create original stories based on given prompts. Students learn about the capabilities and applications of AI language models in generating text.</p>
        <p><b>Lesson 3 - Using AI - Image Model</b> explores AI image generation models and their applications. These models learn to create new images by training on examples and can also transform images. They have various uses, such as creating characters for entertainment, aiding architects, and assisting doctors. However, the lesson also addresses the potential misuse of this technology, such as in deepfakes, emphasizing the importance of responsible usage and ethical considerations.</p>
        <p><b>Lesson 4 - Prompt Engineering</b> introduces the concept of prompts in AI. Similar to asking a question or giving instructions to a friend, prompts are used to communicate with AI and guide its actions or responses. Students learn how to effectively use prompts to achieve desired outcomes when interacting with AI systems.</p>
        <p><b>Lesson 5 - Creating Images with AI.</b>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made it easier than ever to create images that
        are stunning and visually compelling. By using AI tools, it's possible to
        generate images without the need for any artistic skill and in a fraction of the
        time that it would take to produce them manually.</p>
        <p><b>Lesson 6 - Supervised Learning vs. Unsupervised Learning</b> Supervised Learning is a type of machine learning that is a subset of AI. This is
        the process of teaching the AI model a new skill. It is supervised because a
        human is involved in the process: they label the dataset. The model then
        learns from the labels and eventually can identify the data without the label.
        Unsupervised Learning is another way to train a model using datasets.
        However, this method does not involve labeling of datasets. Instead, the
        model tries to organize and find patterns in the data by itself. It looks for
        similarities and other relationships between the data.</p>
        <p><b>Lesson 7 - Reinforcement Learning.</b>
        Reinforcement Learning is a training method that provides feedback to the AI
        model to encourage or discourage its actions. For this method, the AI model is
        called an agent, and the system providing feedback is the environment. The
        environment rewards the agent with positive points when it performs well
        and negative points when the agent performs poorly.</p>
        <p><b>Lesson 8 - Neural Networks.</b>
        Neural Networks are made of layers of nodes, which are processing blocks
        inspired by the neurons in the human brain. Like our brains, the layers of
        nodes process information by finding patterns and connections in the data.</p>
        <p><b>Lesson 9 – How Generative AI Works.</b>
        Generative AI is the field of AI that builds models that will generate creative
        output, such as stories, music, or art. There are two common techniques used
        in Generative AI systems: GANs and VAEs. Generative AI is used in the creative
        fields as inspiration or a starting point in a longer process.</p>
        <p><b>Lesson 10 - Training a Model.</b> In this lesson, the students will get to train a model themselves. First, we’ll go
        over datasets, and then we’ll explain how the training application works. The
        training application will use images of objects or poses to train the model on
        how to identify those objects or poses. Later in the project lessons, lessons 14-
        16, students will learn how to use their models with CodeMonkey to create games.</p>
        <p><b>Lessons 11 and 12 - AI Game Project.</b> Students learn how to use an image model that they train in a game. The
        lesson steps them through the process of invoking the training application
        from within CodeMonkey’s Create Games activity. Once they train their
        model, they use the model in a game that they create. </p>
