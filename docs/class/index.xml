First, students learn to code using simple commands to move left, right and drop logs. Next, students learn to code repetition using repeat loops executed a fixed or a variable number of times. In the second part of the course, students learn to code using conditional loops. In the third part of the course, students learn to code using conditional statements with simple and compound conditions.</description></item><item><title>Coding Classes in Charlottesville | Blue Ridge Boost</title><link>https://blueridgeboost.com/class/coding/ongoing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blueridgeboost.com/class/coding/ongoing/</guid><description>Fall Class Schedule Coming Soon</description></item><item><title>Coding Group Classes for 4 to 6 year olds | Blue Ridge Boost</title><link>https://blueridgeboost.com/class/coding/preschool-block-coding/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blueridgeboost.com/class/coding/preschool-block-coding/</guid><description>Our youngest students learn fundamental coding concepts by helping a [monkey collect bananas](https://www.codemonkey.com/courses/codemonkey-jr) on instructor-provided Chromebooks. Students learn the basics of coding using left, right, jump up, jump left, and jump right commands to guide a monkey to collect all bananas before opening a treasure chest. In addition, students learn to code repetition by using loops and conditional loops. The course concludes with procedures.
The classes run in four-week sessions.</description></item><item><title>Kids Classes in Charlottesville | Blue Ridge Boost</title><link>https://blueridgeboost.com/class/coding/tweens-coffee-script/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blueridgeboost.com/class/coding/tweens-coffee-script/</guid><description>Students learn fundamental coding concepts using Coffee Script, a beginner-friendly text-based coding language. The young coders use an attractive graphical interface to generate text by pressing buttons on instructor-provided Chromebooks. Some previous experience typing is helpful but not necessary. Classes run in four-week sessions. Each class is 50 minutes long. We adjust classes to the pace of each student. Students typically need between ten to fourteen sessions to complete the course, depending on age and previous coding experience.</description></item><item><title>Lego&amp;reg; Robotics for Children in Charlottesville | Blue Ridge Boost</title><link>https://blueridgeboost.com/class/coding/lego-wedo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blueridgeboost.com/class/coding/lego-wedo/</guid><description>Come and learn to build and program Lego&amp;reg; robots!
In each lesson, students build a Lego&amp;reg; robot using a design model,
improve and extend it, and then create a program using Scratch to
control and move the robot. The robots use a medium power motor to act, depth, and tilt sensor to sense. A Scratch program encodes the robot's actions in response to sensing.
