To facilitate learning, young coders utilize an appealing graphical interface on instructor-provided Chromebooks. While prior typing experience can be advantageous, it is not a prerequisite. Classes are conducted in semester-long sessions, with each session lasting 55 minutes. We tailor the pace of the classes to accommodate the individual progress of each student.
