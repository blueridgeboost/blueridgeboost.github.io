Students ages six to ten learn fundamental coding concepts by helping a beaver build a dam on instructor-provided Chromebooks. First, students learn to code using simple commands to move left, right and drop logs. Next, students learn to code repetition using repeat loops executed a fixed or a variable number of times. In the second part of the course, students learn to code using conditional loops. In the third part of the course, students learn to code using conditional statements with simple and compound conditions.</description></item><item><title>Challenging Math Problems | Blue Ridge Boost</title><link>https://blueridgeboost.com/class/math/challenging-math/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blueridgeboost.com/class/math/challenging-math/</guid><description>Looking for engaging math challenges for your advanced learner?
