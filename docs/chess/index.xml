      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are excited to start a chess program for our more dedicated players, who are ready to learn more about the game and improve their skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The classes start at 10 am with a 45 minutes lesson, followed by three 15-minute games. The pickup time is 12:00.&lt;br&gt;The classes are held at Blue Ridge Boost and are taught by Daniel Wurtzer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Hello my name is Daniel Wurzer and I am excited to teach chess lessons at Blue Ridge Boost this fall. I am originally from Austria and I have played chess since I was 6 years old. For the last 10 years I have been playing at the Charlottesville Chess Club. I focus on strategy, creativity &amp; converting early advantages into wins. I strive to create a positive learning atmosphere, using examples as well as analyzing games to help you achieve your goals and enjoy the game.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>
