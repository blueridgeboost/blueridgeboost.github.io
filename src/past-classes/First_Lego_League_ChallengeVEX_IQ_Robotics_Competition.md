<p>After the end of the FLL season, we will start working on the VEX IQ Competition. </P>

<p>The VEX IQ Robotics Competition "Rapid Relay" takes place on a 6’ x 8’ rectangular field. In the Teamwork Challenge, two robots form an alliance and work together in 60-second matches to score points collaboratively.</p>

<p>Teams also participate in the Robot Skills Challenge, where a single robot aims to score as many points as possible. This challenge includes two types of matches: Driving Skills Matches, which are entirely driver-controlled, and Autonomous Coding Skills Matches, which are autonomous with minimal human interaction.</p>

<p>Students who succeed in the VEX IQ competition typically exhibit the following qualities and skills:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Teamwork and Collaboration:</strong> Successful students work well with their teammates and other teams, sharing ideas and responsibilities effectively.</li>
      <li><strong>Problem-Solving Skills:</strong> They are adept at identifying problems and brainstorming creative solutions, both in the design phase and during the competition.</li>
      <li><strong>Technical Skills:</strong> Proficiency in building and programming robots is crucial. Successful students have a good understanding of robotics, mechanics, and coding.</li>
      <li><strong>Strategic Thinking:</strong> They develop and execute strategies to maximize their score in both teamwork and skills challenges.</li>
      <li><strong>Communication Skills:</strong> Effective communication with team members and mentors is essential. They can clearly convey ideas and provide constructive feedback.</li>
      <li><strong>Adaptability:</strong> They can quickly adapt to changes and unexpected challenges during the competition.</li>
      <li><strong>Persistence and Resilience:</strong> Successful students are persistent and resilient, learning from failures and setbacks to improve their performance.</li>
      <li><strong>Time Management:</strong> They manage their time well, balancing practice, competition preparation, and academic responsibilities.</li>
      <li><strong>Attention to Detail:</strong> They pay close attention to the rules and scoring criteria and ensure their robot meets all specifications.</li>
      <li><strong>Sportsmanship:</strong> They demonstrate good sportsmanship by respecting competitors, judges, and the integrity of the competition.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By developing these qualities, students can enhance their chances of success in the VEX IQ competition.</p>
