description: "Kids Coding Course: Building with Beavers"
summary: "Students learn sequencing, repetition, problem-solving, and conditional logic while developing practical coding skills. The course employs a hands-on, gamified approach that gradually increases in complexity, allowing each child to advance at their own speed. By the end, students can create sophisticated programs, having built a strong foundation in coding and computational thinking."

<p>We start to learn fundamental coding concepts by helping a beaver build a dam! The learning continues with learning to code games in Scratch.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Introduction to coding and its importance</li>
    <li>Basic commands (move, drop)</li>
    <li>Sequential programming</li>
    <li>Repeat loops</li>
    <li>Problem-solving techniques</li>
    <li>Longer and nested loops</li>
    <li>Counter loops</li>
    <li>Conditional loops (until and while loops)</li>
    <li>If statements</li>
    <li>If-else statements</li>
    <li>Event-driven programming</li>
    <li>Compound conditional statements</li>
</ul>

<h5>Our Teaching Approach</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Hands-on coding exercises</li>
    <li>Gamified learning with a beaver dam-building theme</li>
    <li>Gradual increase in complexity</li>
</ul>

<p class="highlight">Join us on this exciting journey from basic commands to creating sophisticated programs!</p>
