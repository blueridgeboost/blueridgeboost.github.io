  title: "Morning"
  monday: "Earth. Camper will learn about cartography, the science of map-making, is introduced as essential for orientation and navigation. Maps provide crucial information about terrain, such as plains, deserts, mountains, rivers, and canyons, helping us plan routes and understand the landscape ahead. Campers will create their own maps and learn how to build and code simple robot to move on the map."
  tuesday: "Satellites. Campers will explore the fascinating world of satellites and their everyday applications while building a small robot that demonstrates circular motion. They will program a LEGO Spike Prime robot to move in an arc, simulating a satellite's orbit around Earth. The lesson will cover the concept of satellites, both natural (like the Moon) and artificial, and explain how they are launched into orbit using rockets. We wll discuss various orbit shapes, focusing on circular orbits but mentioning elliptical ones too. As part of our hands-on activity, campers will construct a robot that moves like a satellite around a model Earth, attaching our phones to capture images, mimicking how real satellites gather data. This interactive approach will help us understand satellite technology and its importance in our daily lives."
  wednesday: "Clearing the landing pad. Campers will build a LEGO Spike Prime robot to clear a simulated Venus landing pad. They will learn key facts about Venus while constructing a robot that navigates obstacles and clears smaller rocks. The project challenges campers to complete the robot's design by creating a front barrier. This activity blends astronomy education with hands-on robotics, encouraging problem-solving skills as campers program their robots to overcome space exploration challenges on Venus's harsh simulated terrain."
  thursday: "Launching into space. Campers will build a rocket-shaped LEGO Spike Prime robot to simulate a deep space mission. They will learn about Voyager 1's 45-year journey, its current distance from Earth, and the Gravitational Sling maneuver. The robot, moving on its third wheel, will incorporate a force sensor for launch. This activity blends robotics with space science, teaching campers about long-distance space travel, communication delays, and the vastness of the universe while they program their robots to venture into simulated deep space."
  friday: "Space crash. Campers will program LEGO Spike Prime robots to simulate a space emergency: navigating an asteroid field with broken navigation systems. They will use the force sensor to detect asteroid collisions, programming their robots to change direction and seek a repair station. This activity teaches the importance of simulations in space missions, while developing problem-solving skills and advanced programming techniques. Through this engaging scenario, campers will gain hands-on experience with space exploration challenges and robotics solutions."

    title: "Afternoon"
    monday: "Moon. Campers will learn about tidal waves in a fun, hands-on way. They will discover how the Moon's gravity pulls on Earth's oceans, causing water levels to rise and fall. Using LEGO Spike Prime robots, they will create a simple model to show how tides work. The robots will move up and down to simulate the changing water levels, just like real tides. Campers will program their robots to show different tidal patterns, like the big tides in some places and smaller ones in others. This activity helps kids understand tides while having fun with robotics and coding."
    tuesday: "First Alien Contact. Campers will program their LEGO Spike Prime scouting robots to display emotions and speak, simulating preparation for an alien encounter on Mars. They will learn about the Red Planet's key features, its potential for future human habitation, and its place in the solar system. As they build their two-motor robots with angled hubs for better display visibility, campers will be challenged to spot and fix an intentional design flaw. This engaging lesson blends space science, advanced robotics programming, and creative play, allowing campers to explore planetary science while developing problem-solving skills and mastering emotion simulation in robots."
    wednesday: "Flight Simulator. Campers build a flight simulator from of a helicopter model, an arm lifting the model and a set of gears that drive the main rotor. The program of this robot reacts to tilting the lever."
    thursday: "Bridge layer is a special mission vehicle! It can detect a gap on its own, deploy a bridge over it and cross to the other side. The mechanism for transporting and deploying the bridge is located in the front (1). The vehicle is solidly put together. The hub (2) in the rear provides counterbalance to the movable arm."
    friday: "Multi sorter is a robot that allows you to sort bricks by their color and size.The upper part of the robot is a movable feeder. When the brick is loaded, the feeder moves it under the sensor for testing, then sends it to the appropriate compartment."
