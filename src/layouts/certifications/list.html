      These credentials are not only widely recognized but also formally qualify and hold approval from the 
      Virginia Department of Education, making them a valuable stepping stone for students pursuing careers 
      in robotics and advanced manufacturing.</p>
    <p>To earn the SMART Robotics Certification, a student must complete five different SMART Robotics Technician 
      micro-certifications and achieve a score of at least 70% on each course's final exam.

      If a student finishes a micro-certification course before the allotted camp time ends, they are eligible to begin another course immediately.
