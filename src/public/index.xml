      <description>Computing At Blue Ridge Boost, we provide individiual tutoring sessions for high ability students in the following subjects:
AP Computer Science Principles (Python) AP Computer Science (Java) Preparation for USA Computing Olympiad Bronze Level Math At Blue Ridge Boost, we teach problem solving skills, rather than drill and memorization. We also teach pre-algebra, algebra, geometry, pre-calculus, and calculus using the Art of Problem Solving textbooks, suplemented with Desmos activities to build a visual intuition, feedback on written solution to learn mathematical writing, and group work on performance tasks where the students apply the material learned in a novel situation.</description>

      <description>Computing At Blue Ridge Boost, we teach computing using play, starting with robots to visualize the programming concepts. The programming exercises use an attractive graphical interface to reinforce concepts through practice.
We believe that students have to be exposed to the same programming concepts in a variety of situations and language variations. For this reason, students learn a few block languages to program WeDo Lego robots, mBot robots, help a beaver build its house.</description>
