    <p>Blue Ridge Boosts offers instructional programs in robotics, coding, and math during the school breaks 
      and days off school.  
    Join us for an exhilarating exploration of robotics, coding, chess, and math. Teamwork and collaboration 
      are at the heart of our camp experience. Students will have the opportunity to work together, share ideas, 
      and solve challenges. Through hands-on activities and group projects, students will develop critical 
      thinking skills and learn the importance of effective communication.</p>
    <p>Blue Ridge Boost is a single focus instructional program, not a day care program. 
      As such, <b>students must be at least six years old for camps.</b> 
      All ages may attend classes, but only those six and older can be dropped off. 
      Thank you for your support in complying with the 
      <a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title22.1/chapter14.1/section22.1-289.030/">licensing regulations</a>. </p>

    <p><b>Flexibile options:</b>To accomodate a variety of schedules, we offer AM, PM, and All Day camps. 
      AM 8:30 to 12:30. / PM 1:00 to 5:00. / All-Day 8:30 to 5:00. <br>
      <b>Daily activities:</b> Each morning and afternoon is divided into two 90-minute sections: one for guided 
      learning and one for free choice. During the guided learning session, students work on an assigned project, 
      with encouragement to extend their work if they finish early. 
      The free-choice session allows students to select from various activities, including:
      <ol>
        <li>Continuing work on the guided session project</li>
        <li>Reading</li>
        <li>Solving math puzzles</li>
        <li>Playing educational games</li>
        <li>Engaging in chess</li>
      </ol>
      In a full day, students participate in two guided learning sessions and two free-choice sessions, providing a 
      balanced mix of structured learning and self-directed exploration.
      
      This structure aims to:
      <ul>
        <li>Foster a blend of focused skill development and creative exploration</li>
        <li>Accommodate different learning paces and styles</li>
        <li>Encourage self-motivation and decision-making skills</li>
        <li>Promote a love for learning through diverse activities </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
               
      <p> <b>Cost:</b>
          5-day AM/PM $355/week &ndash; All-Day $485/week.

    <h2>5-Day Workshops</h2>
    <p><b>Learning Experience:</b>Blue Ridge Boost workshops are an intensive learning experience focused on one specific topic. 
      At Blue Ridge Boost, we are strong believers a student learns 
      by doing the work, rather than by watching a teacher doing it. Students should expect short lessons to 
      introduce the fundamental notions, and then to be asked to try problems that they did not see before. 
      Instructors are ready to help with suggestions and clarifying questions.</p>
    <p><b>Daily activities:</b> Each worskhop has two learning sessions. A learning session consists of a mini-lesson, 
      followed by practice. </p>
    <p><b>Cost:</b> $395/week; 1:30 to 5:30.</p>
