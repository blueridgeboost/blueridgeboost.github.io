<h4>What is the Aerial Drone Competition?</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>A cutting-edge program that prepares students for careers in drone technology</li>
      <li>Four exciting missions: Teamwork, Autonomous Flight, Piloting Skills, and Communications</li>
      <li>Compete in local, and regional events</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>No prior experience needed! We're looking for students who are:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Curious about drones and aviation</li>
      <li>Interested in coding and programming</li>
      <li>Excited to learn piloting skills</li>
      <li>Great at teamwork and communication</li>
      <li>Ready to take on new challenges</li>
    </ul>

<p>
<b>Students are not required to participate in a Competition. </b>
However, the competition is a great way to apply the skills learned in class and to 
meet other students who share an interest in drones and coding.</p>

<p>Local qualifying events will be held from October to March. 
  As of now, no events are currently scheduled for our region.
  We will notify when events are scheduled in our area.
</p>

<h4>Team Information</h2>
<p><strong>Team Size:</strong> 3 to 5 students per team</p>
<p><strong>Roles:</strong> Teams should assign specific roles to members such as pilots, builders, programmers, and documenters to streamline the workflow and responsibilities.</p>

<h2>Season Information</h2>
