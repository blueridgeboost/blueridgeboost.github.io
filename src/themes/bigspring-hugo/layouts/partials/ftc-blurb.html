  <h2>Team Expectations</h2>
<p>We welcome students of all levels to join the FTC team. No prior experience is necessary; we only ask for enthusiasm and a willingness to learn. In addition, we expect students to maintain focus and not be disruptive during team meetings. This ensures a productive and enjoyable experience for everyone involved.</p>

  <h4>No experience necessary! We're looking for:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Coders and programmers</li>
    <li>Builders and tinkerers</li>
    <li>Creative problem-solvers</li>
    <li>Organizers and planners</li>
    <li>Public speakers and presenters</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Competition Structure</h2>
  <h3>1. Game Challenge</h3>
  <p>Each year, FTC announces a new game challenge that teams must address. The game typically involves a complex set of tasks that the robots must perform within a specified time limit. These tasks could range from moving objects to specific locations, navigating obstacle courses, or performing precise maneuvers.</p>

<h3>2. Robot Design and Build</h3>
<p>Teams start by brainstorming and designing their robot using a combination of creativity and engineering principles. They use a standard kit of parts provided by FTC, along with additional materials allowed by the competition rules. The building process involves mechanical construction, electrical wiring, and ensuring structural stability.</p>

<h3>3. Programming</h3>
<p>Once the robot is built, teams program it to perform the required tasks autonomously and via driver control. This involves writing code to control the robot’s movements, sensors, and mechanisms. Teams often use programming languages such as Java or Blockly.</p>

<h3>4. Team Roles</h3>
<p>Each team member typically takes on specific roles, including builders, programmers, drivers, and strategists. This division of labor ensures that all aspects of robot development and competition strategy are covered.</p>

<h3>5. Competitions and Matches</h3>
<p>FTC competitions are held at various levels, starting from local qualifiers to regional and national championships. During each match, teams compete in alliances, where two teams work together to achieve the highest score against another alliance. This format encourages not only competition but also cooperation between teams.</p>

<h3>6. Judging and Awards</h3>
<p>In addition to the robot matches, teams are judged on various criteria such as design, innovation, programming, engineering notebook documentation, and team spirit. Awards are given in multiple categories, recognizing excellence in different aspects of the competition.</p>

<h2>Season Length</h2>
<p>The FTC season typically spans several months, starting with the kickoff event in early September when the new game challenge is announced. Here’s a breakdown of the season timeline:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>September:</strong> Kickoff event and game challenge announcement.</li>
<li><strong>September to November:</strong> Design, build, and program the robot. Teams also practice and refine their strategies.</li>
<li><strong>November to February:</strong> Local and regional qualifying tournaments take place. Teams compete to advance to the next level.</li>
<li><strong>February to April:</strong> State and regional championships are held. Successful teams move on to national or super-regional events.</li>
<li><strong>April to June:</strong> The season culminates with the FTC World Championship, where top teams from around the globe compete.</li>
</ul>
<p>Throughout the season, teams meet regularly once a week, on all teacher workday, and for two weeks from Aust 5th to 12th, to work on their robots and prepare for competitions.</p>
