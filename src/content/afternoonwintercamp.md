## Daily Schedule

Campers will spend two hours daily, from 2m to 4pm working together and individually on fun programming challenges.

1. **Drop Off** at 2 pm
1. **First coding session** (55 minutes)
1. **Break** (10 minutes)
1. **Second coding session** (55 minutes)
1. **Pick up** at 4pm

## Topics

Campers receive instruction in programming concepts including variables, objects, sequential execution, conditional statements, and loops. First, the instructor teaches the concepts in a mini-lesson individually or in small groups. Next, the students practice coding using the concepts learned.

We use primarily the [Code Monkey](https://www.codemonkey.com/) platform on provided Chromebooks. Based on the student's experience and interest they may choose one or more of the following Code Monkey programming exercises: [Banana Tales](https://www.codemonkey.com/courses/banana-tales/), [Coding Chatbots](https://www.codemonkey.com/courses/coding-chatbots/), and [Game Builder](https://www.codemonkey.com/courses/game-builder/). 

No typing experience necessary.
