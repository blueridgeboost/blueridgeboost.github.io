## Daily Schedule

Campers will spend two hours daily, from 2pm to 4pm working together and individually on fun programming challenges.

1. **Drop Off** at 2 pm
1. **First coding session** (55 minutes)
1. **Break** (10 minutes)
1. **Second coding session** (55 minutes)
1. **Pick up** at 4pm

## Topics

Campers receive instruction in programming concepts including
variables, objects, sequential execution, conditional statements, and
loops. First, the instructor will teach a concept in a mini-lesson
individually or in small groups. Next, students will practice coding
using the concepts learned.

We use primarily the [Code Monkey](https://www.codemonkey.com/) platform on provided Chromebooks. Based on the student's experience and interest they may choose one or more of the following Code Monkey programming exercises: [Banana Tales](https://www.codemonkey.com/courses/banana-tales/), [Coding Chatbots](https://www.codemonkey.com/courses/coding-chatbots/), and [Game Builder](https://www.codemonkey.com/courses/game-builder/). 

### COVID-19 Mitigation Protocols

1. Maximum class size is 4 students.
1. All campers are required to provide proof of COVID-19 vaccination.
1. All members of the instructor's household are COVID-19 vaccinated (all adults are also boosted).
