            <p><i>Introduction to Computer Science with MakeCode for Minecraft</i> is an educational course designed to merge the creative allure of Minecraft with the foundational principles of computer science. Using Microsoft's MakeCode, a block-based coding platform, students are empowered to write code that manipulates and interacts with the Minecraft world. This course provides an engaging, interactive environment where learners of all ages can develop computational thinking skills, understand coding logic, and apply problem-solving techniques in real-time. By integrating a popular gaming platform with educational content, the course not only makes learning to code accessible and enjoyable but also fosters creativity and collaboration among students.</p>

                        <b>Monday: </b><a href="https://minecraft.makecode.com/courses/csintro/events">Events</a><br>
                        Campers will explore events and event handlers, crucial concepts in all programming languages. We will begin with a fun activity to understand cause and effect, then apply what we have learned by using MakeCode in Minecraft. Finally, campers will create your own MakeCode projects, using events to drive different parts of your program.<br>
                        <b>Tuesday: </b> <a href="https://minecraft.makecode.com/courses/csintro/variables">Variables</a><br>
                        Campers will delve into the concept of variables, crucial tools for storing information and enhancing the flexibility of programs. Building on our previous discussion about events, campers will use variables to pass extra information when an event is triggered. To conclude, campers will be tasked with writing their own program that employs variables to tailor its functionality.<br>
                        <b>Wednesday: </b><a href="https://minecraft.makecode.com/courses/csintro/conditionals">Conditionals</a><br>
                        Campers will learn that computer programs are composed of instructions that manage how to handle input and produce output. These instructions are set into motion by events or commands, which dictate the actions within the Minecraft world. An essential part of their programming experience involves learning WHEN to execute a specific task. This decision-making process uses 'conditionals', which require a particular Condition or Rule to be met before an action is initiated.<br>
                        <b>Thursday: </b><a href="https://minecraft.makecode.com/courses/csintro/arrays">Arrays</a><br>
                        Campers will discover that in computer science, an array acts as a series of storage spaces. Previously, they learned about using variables to store information. Unlike variables that hold a single value, arrays can store multiple values and are accessed as a single object, the array itself. This lesson will expand on the concept of storing information for later use, but with multiple values. Campers will explore the usefulness of arrays as collections of related items and learn how to utilize array operations to add and retrieve items, which helps in organizing and recalling information.<br>

                        Campers will focus on navigating the Minecraft world using the three-coordinate grid system (X, Y, Z) and understanding the concepts of relative and world positions. We will guide the campers through creating a compass rose to aid in your navigation. Additionally, we will introduce a tool that enables  copy and paste of entire structures within the Minecraft environment.<br>
                        <b>Tuesday: </b><a href="https://minecraft.makecode.com/courses/csintro/iteration">Iteration</a><br>
                        In this lesson, campers will dive into the power of repetition in coding, get acquainted with the Agent—a helpful robot—and create some fun dance moves. They will then program the Agent to perform a unique task they design themselves.<br>
                        <b>Wednesday: </b><a href="https://minecraft.makecode.com/courses/csintro/functions">Functions</a><br>
                        Campers will learn that in programming, certain tasks or procedures are often repeated within the same program. Instead of rewriting the same lines of code every time they are needed, campers can group these instructions into a function. By creating a function for frequently used instructions, their code becomes more efficient. Once a function is written, campers can simply 'call' it from anywhere in their program to perform the task. Functions are typically named after the task they perform, which also makes the code clearer and easier to understand.<br>
