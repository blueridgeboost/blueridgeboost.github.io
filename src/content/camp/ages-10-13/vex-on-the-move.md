        Experience the excitement of robotics and competition at the "On The Move", where campers will dive into the world of VEX IQ robotics. Participants start by building a Simple Clawbot and learn to drive it to score goals in an exhilarating one-on-one Robot Soccer challenge. The adventure continues as campers enhance their robots by designing and constructing manipulators to improve their robots' abilities to grab, pass, and score. Collaborative team strategy sessions are a key part of the camp, culminating in a team Robot Soccer Competition. Additionally, campers explore mechanical concepts such as gearing, applying their knowledge to optimize their robots for power or speed in a Tug of War Competition. This camp not only sharpens technical skills but also emphasizes the development of teamwork and communication, essential skills for future success in any field.
