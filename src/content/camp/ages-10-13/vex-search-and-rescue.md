        In this hands-on robotics camp, students will work collaboratively to construct a VEX IQ Clawbot, a versatile robot known for its capability to grasp and manipulate objects. The initial challenge involves assembling the Clawbot and programming it to efficiently transport objects from one location to another, utilizing both manual drive control and automated coding strategies. To enhance the robot's functionality, an Optical Sensor will be integrated, enabling the Clawbot to identify and sort objects based on color, specifically designed to detect various colored cubes. Further expanding the project's scope, students will innovate and engineer diverse mechanical attachments and mechanisms. This customization will prepare the Clawbot to compete effectively in the "Up and Over Competition," where agility, speed, and precision are crucial for navigating obstacles and completing tasks. This project not only sharpens technical skills in robotics and coding but also fosters teamwork and problem-solving abilities. <br>
        This camp is suited for students who have little to no experience with VEX IQ Kits.
