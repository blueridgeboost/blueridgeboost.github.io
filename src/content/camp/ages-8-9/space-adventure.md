        <p>Campers will embark on a "space adventure" using robots, where they construct various robotic structures designed for this level. They will learn to control the motors to enable the robots to execute precise movements around models of the "earth," "moon," and "sun." After encountering various obstacles, campers will utilize a force sensor to navigate past them successfully. Throughout this adventure, they will also discover fascinating facts about the solar system and space vehicles.</p>
