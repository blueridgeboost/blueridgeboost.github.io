# Coding Group Classes for Early Coders

<div class="row">



<div class="col-sm-10">

Our youngest students learn fundamental coding concepts by helping a [monkey collect bananas](https://www.codemonkey.com/courses/codemonkey-jr) on instructor-provided Chromebooks. Students learn the basics of coding using left, right, jump up, jump left and jump right commands to guide a monkey to collect all bananas before opening a treasure chest. Students learn to code repetition by using loops and conditional loops. The course concludes with procedures.

The classes run on 4 week-sessions. Each class is 30 minutes long. Classes are adjusted to the pace of the student with students typically needing six sessions to complete the course.

#### Session 1. Sequencing

Students build a foundation in coding and problem-solving.<br>

**Lesson 1.** What is coding? <br>
Students learn that coding is giving precise instructions to a computer. Each student creates their first program – a dance routine for the class to follow!

**Lesson 2.** Program using the computer <br>
Introduces the coding platform Code Monkey. Students do their first coding exercises on the computer, using commands to move left and right.

**Lesson 3.** Complex sequential programs <br>
Students learn two new commands and how to code using advanced planning. 

**Lesson 4.** Increasingly complex programs <br>
Students learn one more command, jump, and use the commands they know to solve increasingly complex problems.

#### Session 2. Loops 

Students learn loops, a fundamental coding concept.<br>

**Lesson 1.** Efficient programs<br>
Students learn that a problem may have multiple solutions and judge which one is more efficient.

**Lesson 2.** Programming repetition <br>
Students learn to write concise code using loops. 

**Lesson 3.** Longer loops<br>
Students continue their practice with repeat loops containing two or more commands.

**Lesson 4.** What stops the loop? <br>
Students explore why some loops finish and others run forever (a deep question in theoretical computer science!)

#### Session 3. Advanced Sequencing and Looping

**Lesson 1.** Back and Forth<br>
Students need to plan their journey as they will need to go in one direction first and then
return to get to the treasure chest.

**Lesson 2.** Where to first? <br>
In this lesson, students will continue practicing solving challenges by planning their
journey. They will need to decide where to move first to get all the bananas.


**Lesson 3.** Behind you, Monkey<br>
STudents complete the advanced sequencing chapter by coding increasingly complex paths.


**Lesson 4.** Loops Again <br>
In this lesson, students will start the Advanced Loops chapter.
Up until now, the students solved the challenges using a loop and blocks inside the
loop. In this lesson, students will add blocks before the loop. They will need to see the pattern to use a loop. They will need to identify where the loop starts and how
to get the monkey to the starting point.

#### Session 4. Advanced and Conditional Looping

**Lesson 1.** Until When<br>
In this lesson, students will continue solving challenges using loops. They will need to
identify the repetitive pattern and the blocks that should be before the loop.

**Lesson 2.** Until the End <br>
Students complete advanced looping and code loops that are three to four commands long. 

**Lesson 3.** Back to Business<br>
In this lesson, students will start a new chapter of CodeMonkey Jr., which focuses on
conditional loops. Conditional loops are loops that repeat based on a certain condition.

**Lesson 4.** Plan, Plan, Plan <br>
In this lesson, students will continue practicing solving challenges by planning their
journey. They will need to decide which instructions are before and after the loop and
which instructions are included within the loop.

#### Session 5. Advanced Conditional Looping

**Lesson 1.** It is complicated<br>
In this lesson, the loop is getting complicated – the basic step within the loop is
composed of two instructions.

**Lesson 2.** Two is a company <br>
Up until now, the students solved the challenges using a single loop and blocks inside the loop. In this lesson, 
students will learn how to implement two separate loops one after the other.

**Lesson 3.** Look Around<br>
Students will use multiple loops as required for moving back and forth.

**Lesson 4.** Three is more fun <br>
In this lesson, students will learn how to add more than two loops and how to use the same conditional loop for different parts of the solution.

#### Session 6. Procedures

**Lesson 1.** What is a procedure?<br>
In this lesson, students will learn how to write procedures and what characterizes a modular solution. 

**Lesson 2.** Can you do it? <br>
In this lesson, the students will continue writing procedures and will see how simple
the use of procedures is and the flexibility it gives the program.

**Lesson 3.** You are the master<br>
In this lesson, the challenges are getting complicated. Students need to use 2 or 3
procedures in each challenge and the code in each procedure is getting longer.

**Lesson 4.** Advanced Procedures <br>
Students will face challenges with validating the path and moving in both directions to get to the bananas as well as the treasure chest.
