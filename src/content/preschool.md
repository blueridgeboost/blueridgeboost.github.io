#### Session 1. Sequencing

Students build a foundation in coding and problem solving.<br>

**Lesson 1.** What is coding? <br>
Students learn that coding is giving precise instructions to a computer. Each student creates their first program â€“ a dance routine for the class to follow!

**Lesson 2.** Program using the computer <br>
Introduces the coding platform Code Monkey. Students do their first coding exercises on the computer, using commands to move left and right.

**Lesson 3.** Complex sequential programs <br>
Students learn two new commands and how to code using advanced planning. 

**Lesson 4.** Increasingly complex programs <br>
Students learn one more command, jump up, and use the commands they know to solve increasingly complex problems.

#### Session 2. Loops 

Students learn loops, a fundamental coding concept.<br>

**Lesson 1.** Efficient programs<br>
Students learn that a problem may have multiple solutions and to judge which one is more efficient.

**Lesson 2.** Programming repetition <br>
Students learn to write concise code using loops. 

**Lesson 3.** Longer loops<br>
Students continue their practice with repeat loops containing two or more commands.

**Lesson 4.** What stops the loop? <br>
Students explore why some loops finish and others run forever (a deep question in theoretical computer science!)
