        <b>Lab 2. Pollination.</b> What's creating such a stir? Your classroom's Sphero robot is taking on the role of a diligent bee today. Dive into programming it to flit from flower to flower, mimicking pollination, before buzzing back to its hive to 'produce honey.' Let's explore how to bring this industrious scenario to life through coding.

        <b>Lab 3. Journey to the Center of the Earth.</b> Our home, the Earth, is far more than a mere solid sphere; it's a complex world composed of distinct layers. In this activity, you'll get acquainted with the Block Programming interface of Sphero and embark on a coding adventure that takes you through the planet's crust, mantle, and all the way down to its core.

        <b>Lab 4. Mimicry.</b> Whether you're the one being imitated by a younger sibling, or you're the younger one who enjoys mimicking an older sibling, the concept of mimicry isn't unique to humans. In the animal kingdom, many species engage in mimicry, adeptly copying the behaviors or appearances of other animals for various benefits.

        <b>Lab 6. Sleep Cycles.</b> While we all understand the necessity of slumber, the intricacies of what occurs during sleep remain a mystery to many. In this exercise, you will code a Sphero robot to illustrate the five stages of sleep, employing loops to represent each phase's cyclical nature.

        <b>Lab 7. What a Seed Needs.</b> Imagine being a tiny seed in the vast expanse of nature, where the essentials like water, warmth, and sunlight might be scarce. Ready to test your luck in the seed survival stakes? First up, you'll need to get to grips with new control blocks and comparators to patch up the program. Let's see if you can thrive and grow in this seed survival challenge.

        <b>Lab 8. Day or Night?</b> Owls, possums, and bats share their night-loving nature; they're all nocturnal creatures that thrive in the darkness. Could we code our Sphero to emulate a nocturnal animal's nocturnal behavior, and then switch gears to imitate the daytime activities of a diurnal animal? Let's put our programming skills to the test.

        <b>Lab 11. Treasure Hunt.</b> In this activity, you'll craft two distinct programs: the first will transform your BOLT into a "metal detector," and the second will turn it into the "buried treasure" itself. Afterward, team up with another group and employ your Sphero robot's infrared (IR) communication to embark on a treasure hunt.
