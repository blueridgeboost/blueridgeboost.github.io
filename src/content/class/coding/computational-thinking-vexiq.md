            <p>Using VEX IQ robotics kits and the visual programming software VEXcode, students will bring codes to life as they learn programming basics like loops and conditionals. They'll have a blast watching their robots complete challenges like following a line, sorting objects, and more - all through their own code.</p><p>
            Your child will be fully engaged as they progress through our step-by-step lessons at their own pace. From basic movements to fully automated solutions, each project builds on the last.</p><p>
            It's amazing to see the "lightbulb" moment when their code controls the robot. Through hands-on projects, coding comes alive and they gain skills in critical thinking, teamwork, and engineering. Lessons also inspire creativity, perseverance, and spark interests that last.</p><p>
            Sign up today to provide an inspiring introduction to computational thinking. We guarantee your child will love attending our robotics coding class each week. Join us to ignite that early passion that just may shape their future career path. The potential for discovery has never been more hands-on!</p><p>
