            <p>Using VEX IQ robotics kits and the visual programming software VEXcode, students will bring codes to life as they learn programming basics like loops and conditionals. They'll have a blast watching their robots complete challenges like following a line, sorting objects, and more - all through their own code.</p><p>
            Your child will be fully engaged as they progress through our step-by-step lessons at their own pace. From basic movements to fully automated solutions, each project builds on the last.</p><p>
            It's amazing to see the "lightbulb" moment when their code controls the robot. Through hands-on projects, coding comes alive and they gain skills in critical thinking, teamwork, and engineering. Lessons also inspire creativity, perseverance, and spark interests that last.</p><p>
            Sign up today to provide an inspiring introduction to computational thinking. We guarantee your child will love attending our robotics coding class each week. Join us to ignite that early passion that just may shape their future career path. The potential for discovery has never been more hands-on!</p><p>

        The course takes six to nine months to complete. <br>
        <p><b>Unit 1: Getting Started with VEX IQ</b><br> 
        The Getting Started unit covers setting up the VEX IQ 2nd generation robot's hardware and firmware, as well as how to build, compile, and run programs in VEXcode IQ Blocks. 
        </p>
        <p><b>Unit 2: Programming the Brain with VEX IQ</b><br> 
        In this unit, you will learn how to control the output on the VEX IQ Robot Brain's screen with sequential programming. You will program with lines, shapes, colors, and text to customize a screen display! 
        </p>
        <p><b>Unit 3: Robot Movement with VEX IQ</b><br> 
        In this unit, you will learn how to control the basic movement of the VEX IQ Clawbot through sequential programming. You will program your robot to perform simple maneuvers and manipulate objects in its environment.
        </p>
        <p><b>Unit 4: Digital Sensors with VEX IQ</b><br> 
        In this unit, you will learn how to use the digital sensors on the VEX IQ 2nd Gen Clawbot. You will program your robot to perform simple sensing behaviors and respond to objects in its environment with the Touch LED sensor and Bumper Sensor.
        </p>
        <p><b>Unit 5: Analog Sensors with VEX IQ</b><br> 
        In this unit, you will learn how to use the analog sensors on the VEX IQ 2nd Gen Clawbot. You will program your robot to perform simple sensing behaviors and respond to objects in its environment with the Distance sensor and Optical Sensor. 
        </p>
        <p><b>Unit 6: Loops with VEX IQ</b><br> 
        In loops with VEX IQ, you will learn how to repeat sequences of commands.
        </p>
        <p><b>Unit 7: Discrete Decisions with VEX IQ</b><br> 
        In this unit, you will learn how to program the robot to make one-time decisions, repeat decisions, and detect obstacles.
        </p>
        <p><b>Unit 8: Capstone: Subterranean Challenge with VEX IQ</b><br> 
        In this unit, you will demonstrate your ability to decompose an open-ended problem into small pieces, and then iterate on a robust solution to the problem. 
        </p>
        <p><b>Unit 9: Continuous Decisions with VEX IQ</b><br> 
        In this unit, you will learn how to program your robot to detect obstacles and line track with the use of continuous decisions.
