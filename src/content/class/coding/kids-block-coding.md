<div class="col-sm-12 left">Students ages six to ten learn fundamental coding concepts by helping a beaver build a dam on instructor-provided Chromebooks. First, students learn to code using simple commands to move left, right and drop logs. Next, students learn to code repetition using repeat loops executed a fixed or a variable number of times. In the second part of the course, students learn to code using conditional loops. In the third part of the course, students learn to code using conditional statements with simple and compound conditions.  

The classes run in 4 week-sessions. Each class is 45 minutes long. We adjust to the student's pace, with students typically needing between four and six sessions to complete the course depending on age and previous coding experience.

#### Session 1. Sequencing and Loops 

Students build a foundation in coding and problem-solving.<br>

**Lesson 1.** What is coding? <br>Students learn that coding is giving precise instructions to a computer. Then, each student creates their first program – a dance routine for the class to follow!

**Lesson 2.** Program using the computer <br>
Introduces the coding platform Code Monkey. Students do their first coding exercises, using commands to drop and move right.

**Lesson 3.** Complex sequential programs <br>
Students learn two new commands and how to code using advanced planning. 

**Lesson 4.** Programming repetition <br>
Students learn to write concise code using loops.

#### Session 2. Complex problems 

Students build a foundation in coding and problem-solving.<br>

**Lesson 1.** Longer loops<br>
Students continue their practice with repeat loops whose bodies are two or more commands.

**Lesson 2.** Problem-solving <br>
Students learn to solve problems by splitting the problems into simpler subproblems and solving each subproblem separately. 

**Lesson 3.** Nested loops<br>
Students create complex programs with loops within loops.

**Lesson 4.** Counter loops <br>
Students learn to create and analyze programs with counter loops.

#### Session 3. Conditional Loops 

In this session, the students learn conditional loops, which repeat based on a given condition, and master using loops, combinations between loops, nested loops, and more.<br>

**Lesson 1.** Let’s Build Our House <br>
Students learn the concept of until loops and practice coding with them.

**Lesson 2.** Do not Fall Off the Roof <br>
Students learn new commands and create complex programs.

**Lesson 3.** Beware of the Fish <br>
This lesson is focused on introducing the ``while`` loop and solving complex challenges with new combinations of
consecutive and nested loops.

**Lesson 4.** The Loop Master <br>
In this lesson the students will learn how to implement ``while`` loops with multiple conditional
statements and practice more nested loops ``while`` helping the Beaver fix broken tiles.

#### Session 4. If/Else Conditions  

Students will learn about conditional statements that can decide whether or not to execute code
based on whether a given condition is valid.
Students will complement their fundamental algorithmic knowledge
with conditional execution.

**Lesson 1.** Make the Right Decision <br>
Students learn to code using conditional ``if`` statements.

**Lesson 2.** It is Either This or That <br>
Students learn to code using conditional ``if-else`` statements.

**Lesson 3.** Let’s Build a Factory <br>
Students learn the fundamentals of event-driven programming.

**Lesson 4.** Group by Color <br>
Students learn to code using compound conditional statements.
