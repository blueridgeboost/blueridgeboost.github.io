            <p>The <a href="https://www.firstlegoleague.org/about#">FIRST LEGO League</a> Challenge curriculum immerses students in research, problem-solving, coding, and engineering, providing diverse, challenging, and relevant learning experiences. Students are tasked with developing innovative solutions to real-world problems and designing, building, and coding a LEGO robot that can tackle themed challenge missions.</p>>
            <p>The 2023-2024 art-themed MASTERPIECE materials will help students imagine and innovate new ways to create and communicate art globally.</a>

            <p>At Blue Ridge Boost, students work in pairs using one SPIKE Prime set to ensure each student has the time and the tools to share their ideas and experiment.</p>
            <p><b>The preparation class progresses at a slower pace than the competition level and teaches students to build and experiment with robots to complete the same missions as the competition class.</b></p>
            <p><b>The students in the FLL Challenge class must commit to attending most of the sessions and to participate in a competition, usually in November and December in Richmond.</b></p>
