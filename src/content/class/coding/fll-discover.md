            <p>The <a href="https://www.firstlegoleague.org/about#">FIRST LEGO League</a> Discover is a fun and engaging STEM program designed for teams of children aged 4-6, which nurtures their innate curiosity and fosters lifelong learning habits. By the end of the program, children emerge with greater confidence, better equipped to tackle upcoming challenges, and with a newfound passion for learning. 
            </p>
            <p>Every year, a fresh and thrilling Challenge is unveiled, and each team of eight kids commences their exploration of the real-world theme with an exclusive LEGO Education Discover Set. This year’s challenge is called MASTERPIECES. Children will learn about how people’s passion for the arts is shared through STEM.
            </p><p>
            Using LEGO® DUPLO® elements, the teams build a solution to the challenge, starting with the set as their foundation. The teams then share their journey, ideas, models, and STEM skills at a celebratory event. Throughout the program, the teams adhere to FIRST Core Values, which encourage discovery and teamwork while having fun!</p>
            <p>Furthermore, each student receives a Discover More set that includes two sets of Six Bricks. Curated by The LEGO Foundation, these sets are a valuable resource for children and their families to practice memory, movement, creativity, and other skills through short, fun, playful activities.</p>
