            <h2>Introducing Coding with LEGO and Python!</h2>
            <p>Is your child curious about computer science but struggling to see how coding relates to the real world? This new LEGO SPIKE Prime Python course is the perfect hands-on introduction.</p><p>
            Through building and programming LEGO robots, your child will learn important coding concepts like loops, conditionals, variables, and functions - all while solving fun challenges like making their bots follow lines, play sounds, and more.</p><p>
            The course uses the intuitive Python programming language so concepts transfer well to other platforms. And with guidance from their teacher, students get individual support troubleshooting code.</p><p>
            Your child will develop lifelong skills like problem-solving, collaboration, and debugging - all while having a blast tinkering with their creations. They'll design prototypes, give and receive feedback, and iteratively improve their robots.</p><p>
            By the end of the course, your child will be able to plan out solutions algorithmically and have a solid coding foundation to take their interests further. And best of all, they'll be having so much fun they won't even realize they're learning!</p><p>
            Give your child a head start in computer science through hands-on robotics coding with LEGO and Python.
