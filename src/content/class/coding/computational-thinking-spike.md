            <h2>Introducing Your Child to Coding and Robotics</h2>
            <p>Are you looking for a fun, hands-on way to spark your child's interest in technology? Our new coding and robotics class uses LEGO SPIKE Prime programmable robots and the visual programming language Scratch to teach important computer science skills.</p><p>
            Through a series of real-world projects, your child will learn computational thinking patterns like conditional logic, iteration, and problem-solving. They'll enjoy bringing their virtual programs to life by making the robot sort, move, and respond to its environment.</p><p>
            Your child will be amazed by watching their programming come alive through the robot's movements and reactions. They'll gain skills in tinkering, troubleshooting, and the design process. All while having fun building, coding, and problem-solving with LEGO bricks.</p><p>
            Sign up today and discover how our coding and robotics class fosters creativity, collaboration, and perseverance in an inspirational way. Your child will learn strategies to solve all kinds of challenges - from virtual code blocks to real-world tasks. Join us to start them on the path of programming the future!
