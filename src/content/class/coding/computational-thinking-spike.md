            <h2>Introducing Your Child to Coding and Robotics</h2>
            <p>Are you looking for a fun, hands-on way to spark your child's interest in technology? Our new coding and robotics class uses LEGO SPIKE Prime programmable robots and the visual programming language Scratch to teach important computer science skills.</p><p>
            Through a series of real-world projects, your child will learn computational thinking patterns like conditional logic, iteration, and problem-solving. They'll enjoy bringing their virtual programs to life by making the robot sort, move, and respond to its environment.</p><p>
            Your child will be amazed by watching their programming come alive through the robot's movements and reactions. They'll gain skills in tinkering, troubleshooting, and the design process. All while having fun building, coding, and problem-solving with LEGO bricks.</p><p>
            Sign up today and discover how our coding and robotics class fosters creativity, collaboration, and perseverance in an inspirational way. Your child will learn strategies to solve all kinds of challenges - from virtual code blocks to real-world tasks. Join us to start them on the path of programming the future!

        The course takes six to nine months to complete.<br>
        <p><b>Unit 1: Getting Started with SPIKE Prime  </b><br> 
        In this unit, you will learn how to quickly get started with the LEGO SPIKE Prime system and LEGO Education SPIKE programming environment.  
        </p>
        <p><b>Programming the Hub with SPIKE Prime  </b><br> 
        In this unit, you will learn how to control the Light Matrix with sequential programming. You will program the lights to make shapes and display text to give your robot the ability to communicate with the outside world! 
        </p>
        <p><b>Unit 3: Robot Movement with SPIKE Prime  </b><br> 
        In this unit, you will learn how to control the basic movement of your SPIKE Prime robot through sequential programming. You will program your robot to perform simple maneuvers and manipulate objects in its environment.
        </p>
        <p><b>Unit 4: Wait Until & Sensors with SPIKE Prime  </b><br> 
        In this unit, you will learn how to use the sensors on the SPIKE Prime robot. You will program your robot to perform simple sensing behaviors and respond to objects in its environment.
        </p>
        <p><b>Unit 5:Loops with SPIKE Prime  </b><br> 
        In Loops with SPIKE Prime, you will learn how to program the robot to repeat sequences of commands. 
        </p>
        <p><b>Unit 6: Discrete Decisions with SPIKE Prime  </b><br> 
        In this unit, you will learn how to program the robot to make one-time decisions, repeated decisions, and detect obstacles.
        </p>
        <p><b>Unit 7: Capstone: Subterranean Challenge with SPIKE Prime  </b><br> 
        In this unit, you will demonstrate your ability to decompose an open-ended problem into small pieces, and then iterate on a robust solution to the problem. 
        </p>
        <p><b>Unit 8: Continuous Decisions with SPIKE Prime  </b><br> 
        In this unit, you will learn how to program your robot to detect obstacles and line track with the use of continuous decisions.
