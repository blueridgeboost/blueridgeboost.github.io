Come and learn to build and program Lego robots!
In each lesson, students build a Lego robot using a design model,
improve and extend it, and then create a program using Scratch to
control and move the robot. The robots use a medium power motor to act, depth, and tilt sensor to sense. A Scratch program encodes the robot's actions in response to sensing.

The course is structured in four-week sessions. Students build and
code between two and four design models. Depending on the student's
interests and previous experience using Lego bricks and coding, the
course length varies from one session to several sessions.
