        <p><b>Lesson 1. Collecting data.</b> In this lab, you will understand the importance of data collection, explore different types of data, and identify various methods of data collection.</p>
        <p><b>Lesson 2. Surveys and Questionnaires.</b> Data collection serves as the initial step in the data analysis process. Surveys, in particular, are an effective method for collecting data from a large number of individuals. Surveys enable researchers to gather information regarding the attitudes, behaviors, and opinions of a specific population. This data can subsequently be analyzed to identify patterns and trends, providing valuable insights for further analysis and decision-making.</p>
        <p><b>Lesson 3. Data Types and Encoding.</b> Data types play a pivotal role in data analysis as they define the nature of the data stored in variables or columns. The choice of data type impacts the calculations and operations that can be performed on the data.</p>
        <p><b>Lesson 4. Storing Data.</b> As you delve further into data analysis, understanding how to store and organize data becomes crucial. By effectively storing and saving data, you can ensure quick and efficient access for analysis purposes.</p>
        <p><b>Lesson 5. Data Cleaning.</b> By engaging in this lab, you will develop a comprehensive understanding of the significance of data preprocessing and acquire practical skills to clean, transform, and prepare data for analysis. This will enable you to perform accurate and meaningful analyses on your data.</p>
        <p><b>Lesson 6. Organizing Data.</b> Data preprocessing is a critical step in data analysis that involves transforming raw data into a more usable format. Organizing the data includes tasks such as grouping, sorting, filtering, and working with ranges. These techniques help categorize, arrange, extract, and focus on specific subsets of data for analysis purposes.</p>
        <p><b>Lesson 7. Data Visualization.</b> Data visualization is the process of presenting data in visual formats like graphs, charts, and maps. It simplifies complex information, making it easier to understand and interpret. Visual representations enable individuals to identify patterns, trends, and relationships within the data quickly, aiding in data exploration, analysis, and decision-making.</p>
        <p><b>Lesson 8. Bar Charts.</b> Bar charts are a widely used method for comparing different sets of data. They consist of bars or columns that represent data values, with the height or length of the bars proportional to the values being depicted. Bar charts can be arranged vertically or horizontally, and there are different types such as vertical, horizontal, and stacked bars. In this lesson, we will explore these types and learn how to interpret them effectively.</p>
        <p><b>Lesson 9. Pie and Line Charts.</b> In addition to bar charts, there are other types of graphs commonly used in data visualization. Line graphs are useful for showing trends over time, while pie charts display proportions or distributions. Different graph types, such as scatter plots, area charts, and histograms, serve specific purposes depending on the data and insights you want to convey.</p>
        <p><b>Lesson 10. Data Correlation.</b> Data correlation is important for making predictions and understanding cause-and-effect relationships. By analyzing data and identifying patterns, we can make informed decisions and take actions that lead to positive outcomes. It helps us uncover hidden relationships and make data-driven decisions in various fields.</p>
        <p><b>Lesson 11. Statistics and Data Analysis.</b> Statistical tools and techniques are essential for organizing, analyzing, and interpreting large amounts of data. They help us make sense of the data and make informed decisions. These tools include descriptive statistics, inferential statistics, data visualization, data mining, and machine learning.</p>
        <p><b>Lesson 12. Data Predictions.</b> Data prediction is used to draw business insights from data that will help us plan the future.</p>
