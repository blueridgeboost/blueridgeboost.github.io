        <p>Students learn fundamental coding concepts using Coffee Script, a beginner-friendly text-based coding language. The young coders use an attractive graphical interface to generate text by pressing buttons on instructor-provided Chromebooks. Some previous experience typing is helpful but not necessary. </p>
        <p> Classes run in semester-long sessions. Each class is 50 minutes long. We adjust classes to the pace of each student.</p>

#### Unit 1

Students learn that coding is giving precise instructions to a computer, using advanced planning to create efficient programs. Students study objects that can perform several actions.

#### Unit 2

Students learn to code repetitions using loops and variables.

#### Unit 3

Students learn to write complex code using variables and arrays and to use indexing to access array elements.

#### Unit 4
Students learn to code ``for`` loops, variables, and indexing.

#### Unit 5
Students learn functions! They practice writing function definitions and experiment with
defining functions that call each other.

#### Unit 6
Students learn conditional loops that repeat until a condition is satisfied.

#### Unit 7
Students learn the conditional statements `if` and `if else`. Then, they practice using the new statements in conjunction with previously learned concepts, including loops and functions.

#### Unit 8
Students learn the logical operators ``or`` and ``and`` and code conditional statements with compound conditions.

#### Unit 9 through end of course
Students learn the ``not`` logical operator, concepts related to computer games, integer operators, return values from functions, event-driven programming, and more.
