Are you a middle schooler interested in Python? Come and learn with us!

Students learn Python using a combination of lessons that use the Code Monkey platform and Jupyter Notebooks created by the instructor.

Classes run in semester-long sessions. Each class is 50 minutes long. We adjust classes to the pace of each student.

<h4> Unit 1. Sequencing, Objects and For Loops </h4>

Students learn that coding means giving precise instructions to a computer, the concept of objects, and that objects can perform several actions. In addition, students learn to create and manipulate lists, a fundamental idea in computing, and use ``for`` commands to loop through lists. The first three lessons use the Code Monkey&trade; platform, and the fourth introduces students to Jupyter&trade; Notebooks.

<h4> Unit 2. More on Loops, Lists and Variables </h4>

Students deepen their understanding of loops and learn to create complex programs by storing intermediate computations into variables. Two lessons use the Code Monkey&trade; platform, and in the last two lessons, students practice using Jupyter&trade; Notebooks with the ``range`` function and mathematical expressions.

<h4> Unit 3. Conditional Statements </h4>
 Students learn to write programs whose execution depends on the truth value of variables, including ``if``, ``if/else``, and ``while`` commands. Three lessons use Code Monkey&trade;; the fourth is instructor-assigned practice using Jupyter&trade; Notebooks.

<h4> Unit 4. Boolean Operators </h4>

Students learn to code using the Boolean operators ``and``, ``or``, and ``not``. Two lessons use Code Monkey&trade;; the fourth is instructor-assigned practice using Jupyter&trade; Notebooks.

<h4> Unit 5. Functions </h4>

Students learn to define and call functions. One lesson uses Code Monkey&trade;, and the rest are created by the instructor.

<h4> Unit 6. Classes </h4>

Students learn to define classes. One lesson uses Code Monkey&trade;, and the rest instructor-assigned practice using Jupyter&trade; Notebooks.


<h4> Unit 7. Input </h4>

Students learn to create programs that ask for user input or read it from a file. One lesson uses Code Monkey&trade;, and the rest are instructor-assigned practice using Jupyter&trade; Notebooks.


<h4> Unit 8. Strings </h4>

Students learn to work with String data. One lesson uses Code Monkey&trade;, and the rest are instructor-assigned practice using Jupyter&trade; Notebooks.


<h4> Unit 8. Dictionaries, Sets, and Tuples </h4>

Students learn to work with two new data structures, dictionary and set. Two lesson use Code Monkey&trade;, and the rest are instructor-assigned practice using Jupyter&trade; Notebooks.


<h4> Unit 9. 2D Lists </h4>

Students learn to work with two-dimensional lists.  Two lesson use Code Monkey&trade;, and the rest are instructor-assigned practice using Jupyter&trade; Notebooks.


<h4> Unit 10. Search and Sorting </h4>

Students learn to code sequential and binary search, and study the bubble sort algorithm.  Two lesson use Code Monkey&trade;, and the rest are instructor-assigned practice using Jupyter&trade; Notebooks.
