Our youngest students learn fundamental coding concepts by helping a [monkey collect bananas](https://www.codemonkey.com/courses/codemonkey-jr) on instructor-provided Chromebooks. Students learn the basics of coding using left, right, jump up, jump left, and jump right commands to guide a monkey to collect all bananas before opening a treasure chest. In addition, students learn to code repetition by using loops and conditional loops. The course concludes with procedures.

The classes run in four-week sessions. Each class is 30 minutes long. We adjust the classes to the pace of each student. Students typically need six sessions to complete the course.

#### Session 1. Sequencing

Students build a foundation in coding and problem-solving.<br>

**Lesson 1.** What is coding? <br>Students learn that coding is giving precise instructions to a computer. Then, each student creates their first program â€“ a dance routine for the class to follow!

**Lesson 2.** Program using the computer <br>
Introduces the coding platform Code Monkey&trade;. Students do their first coding exercises on the computer, using commands to move left and right.

**Lesson 3.** Complex sequential programs <br>
Students learn two new commands and how to code using advanced planning. 

**Lesson 4.** Increasingly complex programs <br>
Students learn one more command, jump, and use the commands they know to solve increasingly complex problems.

#### Session 2. Loops 

Students learn loops, a fundamental coding concept.<br>

**Lesson 1.** Efficient programs<br>
Students learn that a problem may have multiple solutions and judge which one is more efficient.

**Lesson 2.** Programming repetition <br>
Students learn to write concise code using loops. 

**Lesson 3.** Longer loops<br>
Students continue their practice with repeat loops containing two or more commands.

**Lesson 4.** What stops the loop? <br>
Students explore why some loops finish and others run forever (a deep question in theoretical computer science!)

#### Session 3. Advanced Sequencing and Looping

**Lesson 1.** Back and Forth<br>
Students learn to plan their journey as they must go in one direction first and then
return to get to the treasure chest.

**Lesson 2.** Where to first? <br>
In this lesson, students will continue practicing solving challenges by planning their
journey. They must decide where to move first to get all the bananas.


**Lesson 3.** Behind you, Monkey<br>
STudents complete the advanced sequencing chapter by coding increasingly complex paths.


**Lesson 4.** Loops Again <br>
In this lesson, students will start the Advanced Loops chapter. Until now, the students solved the challenges using a loop and blocks inside it. In this lesson, students will add blocks before the loop. They will need to see the pattern to use a loop. They must identify where the loop starts and how
to get the monkey to the starting point.

#### Session 4. Advanced and Conditional Looping

**Lesson 1.** Until When<br>
In this lesson, students will continue solving challenges using loops. They will need to
identify the repetitive pattern and the blocks that should be before the loop.

**Lesson 2.** Until the End <br>
Students complete advanced looping and code loops that are three to four commands long. 

**Lesson 3.** Back to Business<br>
In this lesson, students will start a new chapter of CodeMonkey Jr., which focuses on
conditional loops. Conditional loops are loops that repeat based on a certain condition.

**Lesson 4.** Plan, Plan, Plan <br>
In this lesson, students will continue practicing solving challenges by planning their
journey. They must decide which instructions are before and after the loop and which inside the loop.

#### Session 5. Advanced Conditional Looping

**Lesson 1.** It is complicated<br>
Students learn to code loops whose bodies are composed of two instructions.

**Lesson 2.** Two is a company <br>
Students learn how to implement two separate loops, one after the other.

**Lesson 3.** Look Around<br>
Students use multiple loops to move back and forth.

**Lesson 4.** Three is more fun <br>
Students learn how to add more than two loops and use the same conditional loop for different parts of the solution.

#### Session 6. Procedures

**Lesson 1.** What is a procedure?<br>
Students learn how to write procedures and what characterizes a modular solution. 

**Lesson 2.** Can you do it? <br>
Students continue writing procedures.

**Lesson 3.** You are the master<br>
Students need to use several procedures in each challenge, and the code of each procedure is getting longer.

**Lesson 4.** Advanced Procedures <br>
Students face challenges with validating the path and moving in both directions to get to the bananas and the treasure chest.
