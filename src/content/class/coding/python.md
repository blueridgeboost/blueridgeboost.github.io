            <b>Who should take this class?</b> <br> 
            Students that:
            <ul> 
                <li>pass the <a href="https://data.artofproblemsolving.com/course-docs/diagnostics/python1-pretest.pdf">pretest</a>
                <li>have had some previous exposure to text-based programming languages, 
                <li>are mature enough to read a textbook, and
                <li>are willing to commit at least an hour of outside class work time.
            </ul>
            Students are expected to read the book chapter at home. In the class, the instructor clarifies important concepts and most of the time is spent coding programming exercises.
