        <b>Lab 1. Pictionary.</b> Sphero is a versatile robot that can be programmed with various coding methods: Draw, Block, and Text. Initially, you'll master programming Sphero by tracing paths on a blank canvas. Following that, you'll employ Sphero to sketch enigmatic pictures, challenging another team to decipher your drawings in a game reminiscent of Pictionary.

        <b>Lab 3. Slam Poetry.</b> Indeed, spoken word is a powerful form of artistic expression! You can use block-based programming to choreograph your Sphero robot's movements, synchronizing them with the recitation of an acrostic poem that represents you. As the robot moves, it can pause, spin, or change direction with each line of the poem, visually embodying the essence of the spoken words.

        <b>Lab 5. Lights! Camera! Action!.</b>Discover the fascinating science behind LEDs and their ability to replicate the entire spectrum of the rainbow through adjustments in the red, green, and blue (RGB) color inputs. By manipulating the intensity values of these three primary colors, you can create a myriad of hues.
        Engage in the creation of abstract light art by programming LEDs to form various geometric colored shapes. This intersection of technology and art allows you to explore the principles of color mixing and design, resulting in visually captivating pieces made from the simple yet intricate manipulation of colored light.

        <b>Lab 6. Sphero Spirograph.</b> Dive into a creative painting experience with a twist! Rather than traditional fingerpainting, take advantage of the Sphero robot's capabilities to craft detailed designs. Utilize the Block Canvas to program the Sphero's path, guiding it through fingerpaints laid out on paper. As the Sphero rolls, it will become your brush, leaving behind a trail of vibrant patterns and bringing a technological edge to your artistic creation.

        <b>Lab 7. Dance Choreography.</b> Unleash your Sphero robot's potential to groove to your favorite beats by drawing from the Choreography Cards. Each card will suggest a different dance move that you can program into your robot. Arrange these moves within loop controls to create a rhythmic sequence that harmonizes with the music. This way, your Sphero will not only dance to the tune but also perform a series of choreographed movements that repeat in sync with the musical loop. Get ready to watch your robot hit the dance floor with style!

        <b>Lab 8. Dance Dance Revolution.</b> Turn the dance floor over to yourself and let BOLT or your Sphero robot take the role of dance master, similar to that iconic arcade game. Crank up your classroom's top tracks and get ready to boogie. Program your robot to flash specific colors or display text to signal different dance moves. As each song plays, keep an eye on BOLT or Sphero, and match your moves to the robot's cues. It's a modern twist on 'follow the leader', merging coding with classic dance-off fun!
