            <p>An experienced instructor teaches mini-lessons on topics commonly found in <a href="https://moems.org/">Math Olympiad</a> contests and leads students in solving carefully selected practice problems. Your child may try to solve a sample contest from Elementary Division (grades 4-6) and Middle School Division (grades 6-8) <a href="https://moems.org/sample/">here</a>. The ideal candidate for the class can solve at least the first or second problem independently and is able to understand a solution to the rest of the problems. </p>
            <p>During the program, your child will be participating in the contests from Mathematical Olympiads for Elementary and Middle Schools (MOEMS®). MOEMS is a nonprofit public foundation that provides opportunities for children to engage in creative problem-solving activities, which develop a child’s ability to reason, be logical, be resourceful, and occasionally be ingenious.</p> 
            <p>The tentative dates for the MOEMS contests are: (1) Friday, December 8, 2023, from 4:30 to 5:00, (2) Friday, January 5, 2024, from 4:30 to 5:00, (3) Friday, February 2, 2024, from 4:30 to 5:00, (4) Friday, March 1, 2024, from 4:30 to 5:00, and (5) Friday, March 29, 2024, from 4:30 to 5:00.
            <p>The Olympiad goals for your child's participation in the contests are:</p> <ul> <li>To stimulate enthusiasm and a love for mathematics</li> <li>To introduce mathematical concepts</li> <li>To teach strategies for problem-solving </li> <li>To develop mathematical flexibility</li> <li>To strengthen mathematical intuition</li> <li>To foster mathematical creativity and ingenuity</li> <li>To provide the satisfaction, joy, and thrill of solving challenges</li> <li>To develop an appreciation of mathematics</li> </ul> 
            <p>Like most worthwhile goals, there is no easy road to becoming a capable problem solver. One must recognize that this may take considerable time and effort to realize. The more time and effort invested, the more one is likely to learn.</p> <p>Your child will practice regularly during the regularly scheduled classes in preparation for five monthly Olympiad contests. Being able to solve a difficult problem is one of the most satisfying experiences one may have. On the other hand, struggling with a difficult problem should indicate to your child that they have found something worthwhile and new to learn. This should be viewed as a challenge and an opportunity to grow.</p> <p>Learning how to solve a problem and understanding its underlying mathematical concepts are the most important goals of mathematics education.</p> <p>Your encouragement and recognition of the importance of the Olympiad goals will help your child enjoy the Olympiad program as well as make progress in becoming a problem solver.</p>
