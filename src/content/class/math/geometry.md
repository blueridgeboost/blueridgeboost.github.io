    <p>In this Euclidean Geometry class, students will embark on a journey to explore the fundamental principles and concepts of geometry. The course begins by introducing the axioms, which serve as the building blocks upon which the entire study of geometry is constructed.</p>
    <p>Students will delve into the intricacies of points, understanding them as the fundamental entities that define the geometric space. They will learn how points can be located and identified, and how they interact within various geometric configurations.</p>
    <p>The class will then move on to the concept of a plane, exploring its properties and characteristics. Students will examine how planes are defined, how they intersect, and how they provide the foundation for geometric shapes and constructions.</p>
    <p>Angles will be a key focus of the course, as students learn to measure and classify them. They will explore the relationships between angles, including complementary, supplementary, and congruent angles, and how they relate to geometric figures.</p>
    <p>The study of triangles will be a central component of the class. Students will investigate the properties of triangles, including their angles, sides, and classifications. They will explore various types of triangles, such as equilateral, isosceles, and scalene triangles, and learn how to apply geometric theorems to analyze and solve problems involving triangles.</p>
    <p>Quadrilaterals will also be extensively covered in the course. Students will study the properties of quadrilaterals, including squares, rectangles, parallelograms, and trapezoids. They will learn to identify and differentiate between these various types of quadrilaterals based on their defining characteristics and properties.</p>
    <p>Throughout the class, students will engage in hands-on activities, problem-solving exercises, and geometric constructions to deepen their understanding of Euclidean geometry. By the end of the course, students will have a solid foundation in the axioms, points, planes, angles, triangles, and quadrilaterals, equipping them with the skills to analyze and reason about geometric shapes and structures.</p>
