#### Get Ready for Algebra 1! 

Join our summer classes in August to participate in a carefully developed curriculum to review pre-algebra, including fractions, ratios, proportions, order of operations, and exponents.

#### Algebra 1 Remediation
The instructor will work with the classroom teacher when available to match the teaching style and materials to maintain **consistency** in the presentation style. For example, in a tutoring session, the instructor **reviews** concepts your student learned in class and assists with homework. If the student needs extra practice, the instructor proposes **new problems** for the student to solve independently.

When your student needs an alternate view or wants to learn a topic not taught in class, our instructors create individualized lessons at the level the student needs.

#### Algebra 1 for Advanced Students

Our instructors are qualified teachers with tutoring experience in middle school math, including algebra and geometry. We use a variety of texts and materials, including the *Art of Problem Solving* curriculum, *Big Ideas Math* textbooks, and *All Things Algebra*.

Students learn by solving challenging problems for a deeper understanding of the subject.
