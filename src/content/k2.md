Students learn fundamental coding concepts by helping a [a beaver build a dam](https://www.codemonkey.com/courses/beaver-achiever/) on instructor-provided chromebooks. Small class size of up to 8 students ensures that each student gets the attention they need to be successful. <br>

Sessions contain 8 lessons. Each lesson is 45 minutes long. The cost per session is $160.

#### Session 1. Sequencing and Loops 

Students build a foundation in coding and problem solving.<br>

**Lesson 1.** What is coding? <br>
Students learn that coding is giving precise instructions to a computer. Each student creates their first program â€“ a dance routine for the class to follow!

**Lesson 2.** Program using the computer <br>
Introduces the coding platform Code Monkey. Students do their first coding exercises, using commands to drop and move right.

**Lesson 3.** Complex sequential programs <br>
Students learn two new commands and how to code using advanced planning. 

**Lesson 4.** Programming repetition <br>
Students learn to write concise code using loops. 

**Lesson 5.** Longer loops<br>
Students continue their practice with repeat loops whose bodies are two or more commands.

**Lesson 6.** Problem solving <br>
Students learn to solve problems by splitting the problems into simpler subproblems and solve each subproblem separately. 

**Lesson 7.** Nested loops<br>
Students create complex programs with loops within loops.

**Lesson 8.** Counter loops <br>
Students learn to create and analyze programs with counter loops.
