#### Session 1. Sequencing and Loops 

Students build a foundation in coding and problem-solving.<br>

**Lesson 1.** What is coding? <br>
Students learn that coding is giving precise instructions to a computer. Each student creates their first program – a dance routine for the class to follow!

**Lesson 2.** Program using the computer <br>
Introduces the coding platform Code Monkey. Students do their first coding exercises, using commands to drop and move right.

**Lesson 3.** Complex sequential programs <br>
Students learn two new commands and how to code using advanced planning. 

**Lesson 4.** Programming repetition <br>
Students learn to write concise code using loops.

#### Session 2. Complex problems 

Students build a foundation in coding and problem-solving.<br>

**Lesson 1.** Longer loops<br>
Students continue their practice with repeat loops whose bodies are two or more commands.

**Lesson 2.** Problem-solving <br>
Students learn to solve problems by splitting the problems into simpler subproblems and solving each subproblem separately. 

**Lesson 3.** Nested loops<br>
Students create complex programs with loops within loops.

**Lesson 4.** Counter loops <br>
Students learn to create and analyze programs with counter loops.

#### Session 3. Conditional Loops 

In this course the students will learn about conditional loops that repeat based on a certain
condition. Students will master the use of loops - combination between loops, nested loops and more<br>

**Lesson 1.** – Let’s Build our House <br>
Students learn the concept of until loops and practice coding with them.

**Lesson 2.** Do not Fall Off the Roof <br>
Students learn new commands and create complex programs.

**Lesson 3.** – Beware of the Fish <br>
This lesson is focused on introducing the while loop and solving complex challenges with new combinations of
consecutive and nested loops.

**Lesson 4.** The Loop Master <br>
In this lesson the students will learn how to implement while loops with different conditional
statements and practice more nested loops while helping the Beaver fixing broken tiles.

#### Session 4. If/Else Conditions  

Students will learn about conditional statements that can decide whether or not to execute code
based on whether a certain condition is true.
Students will complement their fundamental algorithmic knowledge
with conditional execution.
