#### Children

We believe that students have to be exposed to the same programming
concepts in a variety of situations and language variations. For this
reason, students learn a few block languages to program [WeDo Lego](https://education.lego.com/en-us/products/lego-education-wedo-2-0-core-set/45300#wedo-20)
robots, [mBot](https://www.makeblock.com/steam-kits/mbot) robots, help a beaver build its house in the [Code Monkey](https://www.codemonkey.com/courses/beaver-achiever/) framework. Younger students
experiment with [Makey Makey](https://makeymakey.com/) and [Cubetto](https://www.primotoys.com/). Older students may use Python
to program the mBots.
