#### Get Ready for Geometry

Join our Summer classes in August to participate in a carefully developed curriculum to review Algebra 1 topics including linear equations, systems of linear equations, and the Pythagorean Theorem.

#### Geometry Remediation

The instructor will work with the classroom teacher when available to match the style of teaching and materials to maintain **consistency** in the style of presentation.
In a tutoring session, the instructor **reviews** concepts your student learned in class and assists with homework. If the student needs help with some problems, then the instructor proposes **new problems** for the student to solve independently.

When your student needs an alternate view of the topic or just wants to learn a topic not taught in class, our instructors create individualized lessons at the level needed by the student.

#### Geometry for Advanced Students

Students that are ready for a more challenging curriculum are taught logic, proof-based geometry and Euclidean geometry.
