#### Get Ready for Geometry

Join our Summer classes in August to participate in a carefully developed curriculum to review Algebra 1 topics, including linear equations, systems of linear equations, and the Pythagorean Theorem.

#### Geometry Remediation
The instructor will work with the classroom teacher when available to match the teaching style and materials to maintain **consistency** in the presentation style. For example, in a tutoring session, the instructor **reviews** concepts your student learned in class and assists with homework. If the student needs extra practice, the instructor proposes **new problems** for the student to solve independently.

When your student needs an alternate view or wants to learn a topic not taught in class, our instructors create individualized lessons at the level the student needs.

#### Geometry for Advanced Students
Students ready for a more challenging curriculum are taught logic, proof-based, and Euclidean geometry.
