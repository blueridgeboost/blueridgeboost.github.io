#### Children

At Blue Ridge Boost, we teach problem solving skills, rather than drill and memorization. For younger students, we offer math circle type classes, in which students solve challenging problems in groups.

We also teach pre-algebra, algebra, and geometry using the [Art of Problem Solving](https://artofproblemsolving.com/) textbooks, 
supplemented with
interactive [Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/) activities to build a visual intuition, feedback on written
solution to learn mathematical writing, and group work on performance
tasks where the students apply the material learned in a novel
situation.
