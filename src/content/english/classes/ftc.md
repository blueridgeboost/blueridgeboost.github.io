summary: "The FIRST Tech Challenge is an exciting robotics program for students in grades 7-12, allowing teams of up to 15 members to design, build, program, and operate robots in a head-to-head competition structured in an alliance format. However, itâ€™s way more than just building robots. Guided by dedicated adult coaches and mentors, students not only develop essential STEM skills but also engage in practicing core engineering principles. Throughout the process, they learn the importance of hard work, innovation, and teamwork. This hands-on experience helps students realize the value of collaboration and creativity, preparing them for future challenges in both academic and professional settings."
