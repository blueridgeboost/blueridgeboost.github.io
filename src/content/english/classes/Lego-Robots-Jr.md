<h3><strong>Session 1: Introduction to Sphero Indi</strong></h3><p><strong>Objective:</strong> Familiarize students with Sphero Indi, its color-coded tiles, and how it operates.<br> <strong>Materials:</strong> Sphero Indi robots, color tiles, printed activity sheets.</p><ol> <li><strong>Warm-Up (10 min)</strong> <ul> <li>Explain what Sphero Indi is and how it moves based on color tiles (e.g., green = go, red = stop, etc.).</li> <li>Demonstrate basic movement using color tiles.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Activity 1: Meet Indi (20 min)</strong> <ul> <li>Students create a simple path using 3–5 tiles (e.g., green → yellow → red).</li> <li>Place Indi on the path and observe its movement.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Discussion/Reflection (15 min)</strong> <ul> <li>Ask students: What did Indi do when it saw each color?</li> <li>Discuss how different colors "program" Indi to perform actions.</li> </ul> </li> </ol><hr><h3><strong>Session 2: Building Simple Paths</strong></h3><p><strong>Objective:</strong> Practice creating paths that guide Indi to a specific destination.<br> <strong>Materials:</strong> Sphero Indi robots, color tiles, printed grid mat (or flat play area).</p><ol> <li><strong>Warm-Up (10 min)</strong> <ul> <li>Review what each color tile does (e.g., green = go, purple = turn left).</li> <li>Introduce the concept of planning a path before building.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Activity 2: Design a Path (25 min)</strong> <ul> <li>Challenge: Use color tiles to make Indi move from point A to point B on a grid.</li> <li>Students work in pairs to build their paths and test them.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Discussion/Reflection (10 min)</strong> <ul> <li>Ask: Did Indi follow your path as expected? What changes did you make?</li> </ul> </li> </ol><hr><h3><strong>Session 3: Debugging Basics</strong></h3><p><strong>Objective:</strong> Learn how to identify and fix mistakes in a path.<br> <strong>Materials:</strong> Sphero Indi robots, color tiles, printed grid mat.</p><ol> <li><strong>Warm-Up (5 min)</strong> <ul> <li>Review what debugging means (finding and fixing problems).</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Activity 3: Debug the Path (30 min)</strong> <ul> <li>Pre-build paths with intentional errors (e.g., wrong turn tiles).</li> <li>Students test the paths, identify the errors, and fix them.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Discussion/Reflection (10 min)</strong> <ul> <li>Focus on the importance of testing and debugging in programming.</li> </ul> </li> </ol><hr><h3><strong>Session 4: Using Loops</strong></h3><p><strong>Objective:</strong> Introduce the concept of loops by creating repetitive patterns.<br> <strong>Materials:</strong> Sphero Indi robots, color tiles, printed grid mat.</p><ol> <li><strong>Warm-Up (10 min)</strong> <ul> <li>Discuss how some actions repeat (e.g., walking in a square).</li> <li>Introduce the idea of loops and how to simulate them with Indi.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Activity 4: Loops with Indi (25 min)</strong> <ul> <li>Challenge: Design a path where Indi follows a repeated pattern (e.g., a square).</li> <li>Students test and refine their paths.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Discussion/Reflection (10 min)</strong> <ul> <li>Ask: How do loops make programming easier?</li> </ul> </li> </ol><hr><h3><strong>Session 5: Problem-Solving Challenges</strong></h3><p><strong>Objective:</strong> Apply knowledge to solve real-world navigation challenges.<br> <strong>Materials:</strong> Sphero Indi robots, color tiles, obstacle props (e.g., small blocks).</p><ol> <li><strong>Warm-Up (5 min)</strong> <ul> <li>Brief review of color tiles and programming concepts learned so far.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Activity 5: Navigate the Maze (35 min)</strong> <ul> <li>Build simple mazes with obstacles.</li> <li>Students guide Indi through the maze using color tiles.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Discussion/Reflection (10 min)</strong> <ul> <li>Focus on how problem-solving and planning helped them succeed.</li> </ul> </li> </ol><hr><h3><strong>Session 6: Team Collaboration</strong></h3><p><strong>Objective:</strong> Work together to design and implement a complex path.<br> <strong>Materials:</strong> Sphero Indi robots, color tiles, larger grid mats.</p><ol> <li><strong>Warm-Up (5 min)</strong> <ul> <li>Discuss the value of teamwork in solving problems.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Activity 6: Team Path Design (35 min)</strong> <ul> <li>Split students into small groups.</li> <li>Each group creates a path that accomplishes a specific goal (e.g., Indi must visit 3 specific locations).</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Discussion/Reflection (10 min)</strong> <ul> <li>Teams present their paths and explain their design process.</li> </ul> </li> </ol><hr><h3><strong>Session 7: Creative Exploration</strong></h3><p><strong>Objective:</strong> Encourage creativity by designing unique paths and challenges.<br> <strong>Materials:</strong> Sphero Indi robots, color tiles, additional props (e.g., paper tunnels, ramps).</p><ol> <li><strong>Warm-Up (5 min)</strong> <ul> <li>Inspire students by showing creative examples of Indi paths.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Activity 7: Build Your Own Challenge (30 min)</strong> <ul> <li>Students design their own creative paths or challenges for Indi.</li> <li>Optionally, students can trade challenges with peers to solve.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Showcase and Reflection (15 min)</strong> <ul> <li>Share and celebrate creative designs as a class.</li> </ul> </li> </ol><hr><h3><strong>Session 8: Showcase and Celebration</strong></h3><p><strong>Objective:</strong> Reflect on learning and demonstrate mastery.<br> <strong>Materials:</strong> Sphero Indi robots, color tiles, challenge cards, certificates of completion.</p><ol> <li><strong>Warm-Up (5 min)</strong> <ul> <li>Recap key concepts from the previous sessions.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Activity 8: Final Challenge (30 min)</strong> <ul> <li>Students choose a challenge card or design their own task to complete.</li> <li>Encourage independence and problem-solving.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Reflection and Celebration (15 min)</strong> <ul> <li>Discuss: What did you learn about programming and problem-solving?</li> <li>Distribute certificates and celebrate student achievements.</li></ul></li></ol><!--
<p>
	This four-class sequence introduces the students to the world of robotics and coding. Students will construct Lego models that use motors and lights and create code to bring their creations to life. This class is suitable for students with no previous experience using Lego robots.
</p>
<h3>Introducing the Next Generation of Coders!</h3>
<p>The Fundamentals of Coding with SPIKE Essential is the fun and engaging way to teach your elementary students essential STEM skills.
</p>
<p>Through interactive projects and robotics using the LEGO SPIKE Essential kit, children will learn programming basics like sequences, algorithms, conditional logic, and repetition. They will apply these concepts by building real-world machines like excavators and cranes.

<h4>Unit 1: Light Up Snackbot</h4>
<p>
	Snackbot is a robot designed to deliver snacks to office workers. It communicates using lights and sounds. Build a robot like Snackbot and use the Light Matrix to display colored patterns and messages! Source: CS2N.
</p>
<h4>Unit 2: Spinny Snackbot</h4>
<p>
	It's snack time! In this unit, you will learn how to make Snackbot deliver snacks by attaching and programming the motor to make it move. Source: CS2N.
</p>
<h4>Unit 3: Buggy Bugs</h4>
<p>
	Not every program is perfect, some may have errors (a.k.a "bugs"). Let's identify the errors and make a plan to fix them! Source: CS2N.
</p>
<h4>Unit 4: Journey on the Moon</h4>
<p>
	Iris is a lunar rover that drives on the moon collecting data for geological sciences. Build your Iris robot and program it to move forward and explore on the moon! Source: CS2N.

<h4>
Unit 5: Dodging Craters
</h4>
<p>Iris may come across some craters on the moon. Program the robot to be able to turn so that you don't run into them! Source: CS2N.
</p>
<h4>Unit 6: Strawberry Spotting</h4>
<p>Build the Strawberry Plant Sorter. Use the Color Sensor to detect red ripe strawberries! Source: CS2N.
</p>
<h4>Unit 7: Chatty Alien</h4>
<p>What would you do if you met a real alien? This individual is sweet and friendly, but how do you communicate with him? Try it yourself and see how this Chatty Alien reacts to your attempts. Source: robocamp.
</p>
<h4>Unit 8: Dice</h4>
<p>
	Monopoly, Risk, or maybe Boggle? Regardless of the name of your favorite board game, there's a good chance that playing it requires a dice. Build and program your game dice to make every game even more exciting! Source: robocamp.
