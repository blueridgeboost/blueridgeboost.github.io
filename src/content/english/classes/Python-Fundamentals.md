<p>This course is a comprehensive, year-long program designed for middle school students with no prior coding experience. It introduces fundamental programming concepts using Python through interactive exercises and projects centered around controlling a virtual character named Tracy. The course covers commands, functions, loops, variables, conditionals, and lists, progressing to more complex tasks like user interaction and creating visual projects.</p>

Topics include:

<h4>Commands</h4>
    <p>Understanding basic commands is crucial as it forms the foundation of programming, allowing Tracy to perform specific actions.</p>


<div class="topic">
    <h4>Functions</h4>
    <p>Functions are important for organizing code into reusable blocks, making programs more efficient and easier to manage.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic">
    <h4>Loops</h4>
    <p>Loops, including for and while loops, are essential for executing code repeatedly, which is a common requirement in programming tasks.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic">
    <h4>Variables</h4>
    <p>Variables store data that can be manipulated, enabling dynamic programming and the ability to handle varying inputs and conditions.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic">
    <h4>Conditionals</h4>
    <p>Conditionals, such as if and if/else statements, allow programs to make decisions based on certain conditions, adding logic and interactivity.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic">
    <h4>Lists</h4>
    <p>Lists are used to store collections of data, making it easier to manage and manipulate multiple items within a program.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic">
    <h4>User Interaction</h4>
    <p>Incorporating user input and interaction makes programs more dynamic and responsive to user actions.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic">
    <h4>Visual Projects</h4>
    <p>Creating visual projects helps students apply their coding skills in creative ways, reinforcing their understanding through practical application.</p>
