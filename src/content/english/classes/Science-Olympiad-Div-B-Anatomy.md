<p>Dive into the fascinating world of human anatomy with this engaging class focused on the <strong>integumentary, muscular, and skeletal systems</strong>! Students will explore how these three systems work together to protect, support, and move the body. Through interactive lessons, hands-on activities, and real-world examples, participants will:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Integumentary System:</strong> Learn about the skin, hair, nails, and glands, and discover how they protect the body, regulate temperature, and enable sensory perception.</li> <li><strong>Muscular System:</strong> Examine the three types of muscles (skeletal, smooth, and cardiac) and understand how muscle contractions drive movement, posture, and vital bodily functions.</li> <li><strong>Skeletal System:</strong> Uncover the structure and function of bones, joints, and cartilage, and see how the skeleton supports the body, protects vital organs, and enables movement.</li> </ul> <p>By the end of the course, students will gain a deeper understanding of how these systems contribute to overall health and interact to maintain the bodyâ€™s structure and function. This class is perfect for anyone curious about biology, anatomy, or pursuing a career in healthcare or science!</p>
