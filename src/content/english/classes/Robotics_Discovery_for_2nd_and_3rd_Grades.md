<p>This class offers a gentle, engaging introduction to robotics for students in grades 3 and 4. The curriculum is designed to build skills and knowledge throughout the academic year progressively:</p>

<h4>Fall: Vex GO module</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Learn basic robotics concepts and simple programming</li>
</ul>

<h4>Winter: Lego Spike Essential module</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Explore more advanced building and coding techniques</li>
</ul>

<h4>Spring: Sphero Bolt Robotics</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Apply learned skills to program spherical robots</li>
</ul>

<p>Our hands-on approach ensures students gain practical experience with different robotic platforms while developing problem-solving, critical thinking, and teamwork skills.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This class is not recommended for students who have attended Blue Ridge Boost summer camps, as the content may be repetitive for them. We encourage these students to explore our more advanced robotics offerings.</p>
