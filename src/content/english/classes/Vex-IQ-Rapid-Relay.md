Join us for this exciting class! No experience necessary, only a desire to learn and have fun!

Together, we will build a competition-level robot, hone driving skills, and coding with this year's game.

The scoring objects in VEX IQ Robotics Competition Rapid Relay are padded Balls, approximately 6" in diameter.

The primary objectives of the game are to Pass the Balls between Robots, score Balls through Targets, and Clear Switches. Balls are introduced to the field through the Loading Station or, during the last 15 seconds of a Match, a Rapid Load Zone.

Points are awarded based on how many Goals are Scored, how many Switches have been Cleared, and how many times the Alliance successfully Passed the Ball before scoring it.
