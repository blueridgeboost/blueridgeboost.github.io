<p>Join us in February and March to build Lego WeDo robots! </p><p>Material does not repeat in the two sessions.</p><!--
<p>
	This four-class sequence introduces the students to the world of robotics and coding. Students will construct Lego models that use motors and lights and create code to bring their creations to life. This class is suitable for students with no previous experience using Lego robots.
</p>
<h3>Introducing the Next Generation of Coders!</h3>
<p>The Fundamentals of Coding with SPIKE Essential is the fun and engaging way to teach your elementary students essential STEM skills.
</p>
<p>Through interactive projects and robotics using the LEGO SPIKE Essential kit, children will learn programming basics like sequences, algorithms, conditional logic, and repetition. They will apply these concepts by building real-world machines like excavators and cranes.

<h4>Unit 1: Light Up Snackbot</h4>
<p>
	Snackbot is a robot designed to deliver snacks to office workers. It communicates using lights and sounds. Build a robot like Snackbot and use the Light Matrix to display colored patterns and messages! Source: CS2N.
</p>
<h4>Unit 2: Spinny Snackbot</h4>
<p>
	It's snack time! In this unit, you will learn how to make Snackbot deliver snacks by attaching and programming the motor to make it move. Source: CS2N.
</p>
<h4>Unit 3: Buggy Bugs</h4>
<p>
	Not every program is perfect, some may have errors (a.k.a "bugs"). Let's identify the errors and make a plan to fix them! Source: CS2N.
</p>
<h4>Unit 4: Journey on the Moon</h4>
<p>
	Iris is a lunar rover that drives on the moon collecting data for geological sciences. Build your Iris robot and program it to move forward and explore on the moon! Source: CS2N.
</p>
<h4>
Unit 5: Dodging Craters
</h4>
<p>Iris may come across some craters on the moon. Program the robot to be able to turn so that you don't run into them! Source: CS2N.
</p>
<h4>Unit 6: Strawberry Spotting</h4>
<p>Build the Strawberry Plant Sorter. Use the Color Sensor to detect red ripe strawberries! Source: CS2N.
</p>
<h4>Unit 7: Chatty Alien</h4>
<p>What would you do if you met a real alien? This individual is sweet and friendly, but how do you communicate with him? Try it yourself and see how this Chatty Alien reacts to your attempts. Source: robocamp.
</p>
<h4>Unit 8: Dice</h4>
<p>
	Monopoly, Risk, or maybe Boggle? Regardless of the name of your favorite board game, there's a good chance that playing it requires a dice. Build and program your game dice to make every game even more exciting! Source: robocamp.
