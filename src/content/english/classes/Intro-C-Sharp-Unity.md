<p>This class is perfect for students who are interested in developing programming skills for game development.
</p>

This course introduces video game development using C# and the Unity game engine on Windows. C# is highlighted for its suitability for beginners and professional development, while Unity is popular among indie developers, with widespread adoption.

The course assumes no prior programming experience, starting from basics and progressing to small game development. It covers core programming concepts applicable to many languages, with a focus on game development.

While programming is enjoyable, it requires effort. The course is developed for beginners, but it is not easy. Perseverance is required for the successful completion of the course.
