Students learn sequencing, repetition, problem-solving, and conditional logic while developing practical coding skills. The course employs a hands-on, gamified approach that gradually increases in complexity, allowing each child to advance at their own speed. By the end, students can create sophisticated programs, having built a strong foundation in coding and computational thinking. 
<p>We start to learn fundamental coding concepts by helping a beaver build a dam! The learning continues with learning to code games in Scratch.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Introduction to coding and its importance</li>
    <li>Basic commands (move, drop)</li>
    <li>Sequential programming</li>
    <li>Repeat loops</li>
    <li>Problem-solving techniques</li>
    <li>Longer and nested loops</li>
    <li>Counter loops</li>
    <li>Conditional loops (until and while loops)</li>
    <li>If statements</li>
    <li>If-else statements</li>
    <li>Event-driven programming</li>
    <li>Compound conditional statements</li>
</ul>
