<p>Students learn sequencing, repetition, problem-solving, and conditional logic while developing practical coding skills. The course employs a hands-on, gamified approach that gradually increases in complexity, allowing each child to advance at their own speed. By the end, students can create sophisticated programs, having built a strong foundation in coding and computational thinking.</p><p>We start to learn fundamental coding concepts by helping a beaver build a dam! The learning continues with learning to code games in Scratch.</p><ul><li>Introduction to coding and its importance</li><li>Basic commands (move, drop)</li><li>Sequential programming</li><li>Repeat loops</li><li>Problem-solving techniques</li><li>Longer and nested loops</li><li>Counter loops</li><li>Conditional loops (until and while loops)</li><li>If statements</li><li>If-else statements</li><li>Event-driven programming</li><li>Compound conditional statements</li></ul><h5>Our Teaching Approach</h5><ul><li>Hands-on coding exercises</li><li>Gamified learning with a beaver dam-building theme</li><li>Gradual increase in complexity</li></ul><p>Join us on this exciting journey from basic commands to creating sophisticated programs!</p><h3>Important Information</h3><p>Arrival Time: 4:30 PM</p><p>Entry Point: Door labeled "Coding Classroom"</p><p>Teacher: Kha</p><h4>Session 01</h4><ul><li>Introduction to computers<ul><li>What are computers?</li><li>How do we use them in the classroom and at home?</li></ul></li><li>Unplugged coding activity<ul><li>Learning the importance of clear and precise instructions</li></ul></li><li>Online coding platform orientation<ul><li>Getting familiar with the platform</li><li>Completing initial exercises</li></ul></li></ul>
