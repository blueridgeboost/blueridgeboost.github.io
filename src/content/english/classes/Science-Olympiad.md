<h3>4-Class Series: Building a Rube Goldberg Machine</h3> <p>This engaging 4-class series will guide teams through the process of designing, building, and refining a Rube Goldberg device to create the longest-timed chain reaction. Participants will learn how to incorporate the six simple machines—lever, screw, pulley, wheel and axle, inclined plane, and wedge—into their designs. By the end of the series, teams will be ready to compete in a fun and challenging event that tests their creativity, engineering, and understanding of physics.</p><h3>4-Class Series: Designing and Building a Cargo-Holding Barge</h3> <p>This 4-class series will challenge teams to apply engineering principles and physics concepts to design and construct a barge capable of holding the greatest amount of cargo without sinking. Participants will explore buoyancy, displacement, and structural design through hands-on activities and a short knowledge assessment. By the end of the series, teams will have the skills and confidence to create a high-performing barge for competition.</p><h3>4-Class Series: Building a Strong and Stable Tower</h3> <p>This 4-class series challenges teams to design and construct a strong, stable tower using coffee stirrers and masking tape. The goal is to build the tallest tower possible while minimizing the number of stirrers used, and ensuring it can support a mass of 300 grams. Participants will explore concepts in structural engineering, stability, and load distribution through hands-on activities and iterative design. By the end of the series, teams will be prepared to compete and create a winning tower design!</p>
