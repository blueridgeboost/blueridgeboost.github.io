<h3>Fall: The VEX GO Competition</h3>

<p>The VEX GO Competition (VGOC) is an introductory robotics program designed for elementary school students, typically ages 5-11. It uses the VEX GO building system, which features large, colorful, and easy-to-handle components. Teams of students work together to design, build, and program simple robots to complete challenges on a small playing field. The competition emphasizes hands-on learning, problem-solving, and teamwork while introducing young learners to basic engineering and coding concepts in a fun, engaging environment.</p>

The VEX GO Competition series consists of four progressively complex challenges designed to develop students' robotics and STEM skills. It starts with Ocean Science Exploration to introduce basic concepts and build foundational skills. It then advances through Mars Math Expedition and City Technology Rebuild, culminating in the most challenging, Village Engineering Construction. Each challenge includes a STEM Lab curriculum, a theme-based PDF storybook, and specific robot build instructions.

Students who succeed in the VEX GO Competition are curious, enjoy hands-on learning, and have an interest in science and technology. Ideal participants love problem-solving, teamwork, and creative thinking. Those who enjoy building with LEGO or similar toys will find the robot-building aspects engaging. Persistence and adaptability are key, as the series encourages learning through iterative processes. The VEX GO Competition series nurtures a wide range of skills, making it suitable for diverse young learners excited about robotics and STEM.

Blue Ridge Boost will host a competition for all the teams in December.

 <h4>VEX GO Competition (VGOC): Developing Problem-Solving and Critical Thinking Skills</h4>
    
<p>The VGOC helps students develop problem-solving and critical thinking skills beyond just building robots in several ways:</p>

<div class="skill">
    <h3>1. Design Process</h3>
    <p>Students learn to iterate and improve their designs, analyzing what works and what doesn't. This teaches them to approach problems methodically and persist through challenges.</p>
</div>

<div class="skill">
    <h3>2. Strategic Planning</h3>
    <p>Teams must devise strategies to score points efficiently, considering trade-offs and prioritizing tasks. This develops strategic thinking and decision-making skills.</p>
</div>

<div class="skill">
    <h3>3. Troubleshooting</h3>
    <p>When robots malfunction or perform unexpectedly, students must diagnose issues and find solutions, enhancing their analytical abilities.</p>
</div>

<div class="skill">
    <h3>4. Collaborative Problem-Solving</h3>
    <p>Working in teams, students learn to communicate ideas, negotiate solutions, and leverage diverse perspectives to overcome obstacles.</p>
</div>

<div class="skill">
    <h3>5. Time Management</h3>
    <p>With limited time for matches and preparation, students learn to prioritize tasks and manage resources effectively.</p>
</div>

<div class="skill">
    <h3>6. Adaptability</h3>
    <p>Rules or challenges may change, requiring students to adjust their strategies and designs quickly, fostering flexible thinking.</p>
</div>

<div class="skill">
    <h3>7. Systems Thinking</h3>
    <p>Students learn to consider how different parts of their robot interact, developing an understanding of complex systems.</p>
</div>

<div class="skill">
    <h3>8. Computational Thinking</h3>
    <p>Programming their robots introduces students to logical reasoning and algorithm design, even at a basic level.</p>
</div>

<div class="skill">
    <h3>9. Real-World Application</h3>
    <p>Challenges often mimic real-world problems, helping students connect abstract concepts to practical situations.</p>
</div>

<div class="skill">
    <h3>10. Reflection and Improvement</h3>
    <p>Post-match analysis encourages students to reflect on their performance and identify areas for improvement, developing metacognitive skills.</p>
</div>

<p>These experiences help students develop a problem-solving mindset that extends far beyond robotics, applicable to various academic and real-life situations.</p>
