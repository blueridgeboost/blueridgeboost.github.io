        <h2>Class 1: Introduction to 3D Printing</h2>
        <h3>What is 3D printing and what is it used for?</h3>
        <p>3D printing is a process of creating three-dimensional objects from a digital file. It is used in various fields such as manufacturing, medicine, and education.</p>
        
        <h3>How to use a 3D printer?</h3>
        <p>Using a 3D printer involves preparing the design file, setting up the printer, and monitoring the print process.</p>
        
        <h3>Where to find STL files</h3>
        <p>STL files can be found on websites like Thingiverse, MyMiniFactory, and Cults3D.</p>
        
        <h3>How to convert STL to gcode</h3>
        <p>STL files are converted to gcode using slicing software such as Cura or PrusaSlicer.</p>

        <h2>Class 2: Advanced Techniques</h2>
        <h3>Prusa Slicer basics</h3>
        <p>Prusa Slicer is a slicing software used to convert 3D models into instructions for 3D printers.</p>
        
        <h3>How to CAD</h3>
        <p>Computer-Aided Design (CAD) involves creating 3D models using software like TinkerCAD, Fusion 360, or SolidWorks.</p>
        
        <h3>Design considerations while Cading for 3D printing</h3>
        <p>Consider print orientation, support structures, and layer thickness when designing models for 3D printing.</p>
        
        <h3>Design iteration</h3>
        <p>Iterating designs involves testing and refining models to improve functionality and printability.</p>

        <h2>Class 3: Troubleshooting</h2>
        <h3>Common issues with 3D printers</h3>
        <p>Common issues include bed adhesion problems, layer shifting, and nozzle clogs.</p>
        
        <h3>Why some prints fail?</h3>
        <p>Prints can fail due to incorrect settings, mechanical issues, or filament problems.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="class-section">
        <h2>Class 4: Material Considerations</h2>
        <h3>Printing with PLA, PETG, and TPU</h3>
        <p>PLA is easy to print with, PETG is more durable, and TPU is flexible.</p>
        
        <h3>What are the differences between PLA, PETG, and TPU?</h3>
        <p>PLA is biodegradable and easy to use, PETG is strong and temperature resistant, and TPU is elastic and impact-resistant.</p>
