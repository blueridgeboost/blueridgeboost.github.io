<p>
	This six-class sequence introduces the students to the world of robotics and coding. Students will construct Lego models that use motors and lights and create code to bring their creations to life. This class is suitable for students with no previous experience using Lego robots.
</p>
<h3>Introducing the Next Generation of Coders!</h3>
<p>The Fundamentals of Coding with SPIKE Essential is the fun and engaging way to teach your elementary students essential STEM skills.
</p>
<p>Through interactive projects and robotics using the LEGO SPIKE Essential kit, children will learn programming basics like sequences, algorithms, conditional logic, and repetition. They will apply these concepts by building real-world machines like excavators and cranes.

<h4>Unit 5: Dodging Craters</h4>
<p>
Iris may come across some craters on the moon. Program the robot to be able to turn so that you don't run into them! Source: CS2N.

</p><h4>Unit 6: Strawberry Spotting</h4>
<p>
Build the Strawberry Plant Sorter. Use the Color Sensor to detect red ripe strawberries! Source: CS2N.
