<h2>AMC8</h2>

<p>The AMC 8 is a 25-question, 40-minute math contest designed for students in grade 8 and below. It introduces students to a variety of mathematical problem-solving techniques that are different from those typically encountered in school curricula.</p>

<p>The material covered on the AMC 8 includes topics from a typical middle school mathematics curriculum. Possible topics include but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Counting and Probability:</strong> Basic counting principles, permutations, combinations, and probability calculations.</li>
    <li><strong>Estimation:</strong> Approximating values and making educated guesses.</li>
    <li><strong>Proportional Reasoning:</strong> Understanding ratios, proportions, and their applications.</li>
    <li><strong>Elementary Geometry:</strong> Concepts such as the Pythagorean Theorem, areas, perimeters, and volumes.</li>
    <li><strong>Spatial Visualization:</strong> Problems requiring the visualization and manipulation of objects in space.</li>
    <li><strong>Everyday Applications:</strong> Real-world math problems applying mathematical concepts to daily life scenarios.</li>
    <li><strong>Reading and Interpreting Graphs and Tables:</strong> Analyzing and drawing conclusions from various data representations.</li>
    <li><strong>Linear or Quadratic Functions and Equations:</strong> Basic algebraic concepts including solving equations and understanding functions.</li>
    <li><strong>Coordinate Geometry:</strong> Graphing points, lines, and understanding geometric relationships in the coordinate plane.</li>
</ul>
