<h3>4-Class Series: Building a Hydraulic System</h3> <p>In these hands-on sessions, teams will design and construct a freestanding hydraulic device capable of lifting a 100g weight at least 30 cm and holding it for 30 seconds. Using only the materials provided, students will explore the practical applications of hydraulic systems while working collaboratively to solve this engineering challenge.</p><h3>4-Class Series: Origami Glider Relay</h3> <p>In these hands-on events, teams will construct an origami glider (either a Dihedral Magnus Effect glider or a Tumblewing glider) and navigate it through a relay-style obstacle course for the fastest time. Participants must optimize their design during the building phase to ensure their glider performs well in flight. This session emphasizes creativity, precision, and teamwork.</p><h3>4-Class Series: Building a Propeller-Powered Car</h3> <p>In these hands-on sessions, teams will design and construct a propeller-powered car using provided materials. The goal is to create a vehicle capable of traveling a specified distance (5â€“7 meters) as quickly as possible. Participants must optimize their design within the given time and materials, balancing speed, stability, and propulsion. This event emphasizes creativity, engineering principles, and teamwork.</p>
