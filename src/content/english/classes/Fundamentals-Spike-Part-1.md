<h3>Introducing the Next Generation of Coders!</h3>

The Fundamentals of Coding with SPIKE Essential is the fun and engaging way to teach your elementary students essential STEM skills.

Through interactive projects and robotics using the LEGO SPIKE Essential kit, children will learn programming basics like sequences, algorithms, conditional logic, and repetition. They will apply these concepts by building real-world machines like excavators and cranes.

<h4>Unit 1: Light Up Snackbot</h4>
<p>
Snackbot is a robot that was designed to deliver snacks to people within an office. It communicates using lights and sounds. Build a robot like Snackbot and use the Light Matrix to display colored patterns and messages! Source: CS2N.

<h4>Unit 2: Spinny Snackbot</h4>
<p>
It's snack time! In this unit, you will learn how to make Snackbot deliver snacks by attaching and programming the motor to make it move. Source: CS2N.
