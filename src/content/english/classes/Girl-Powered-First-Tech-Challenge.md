<p>We're forming a new FIRST Tech Challenge team and we want GIRLS!<br>
</p><p><em>This is an inclusive STEM class with a focus on empowering girls. While all genders are welcome and encouraged to participate, we strive to maintain a majority female enrollment to address historical underrepresentation in STEM fields. Our goal is to create a supportive environment that inspires girls to explore and excel in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.</em><em></em><br>
</p><p>What is FIRST Tech Challenge?<br>• A robotics competition for students in grades 7-12<br>• Design, build, and program a robot from scratch<br>• Compete in thrilling tournaments against other teams
</p><p>No experience necessary! We're looking for:<br>• Coders and programmers<br>• Builders and tinkerers<br>• Creative problem-solvers<br>• Organizers and planners<br>• Public speakers and presenters
</p><p>What you'll gain:<br>• Hands-on engineering and coding experience<br>• Teamwork and leadership skills<br>• Access to millions in college scholarships<br>• Fun, friendship, and unforgettable memories
</p><p>The team meets once a week when school is in session and on the teacher workdays.
</p><p>The training starts on August 5.
</p><p>Let's rock this rookie year together!<br>
</p><p>We continue improving our game through the end of the school year.
