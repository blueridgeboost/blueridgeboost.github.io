    <b>Math.</b>
    Long-term success in math comes from understanding fundamental concepts and gaining experience and confidence by solving 
    well-chosen problems. Our classes teach students to think like mathematicians and to 
    developing foundational skills and the ability to approach challenges creatively.
</p>  
<p>
    <b>Computer Coding.</b>
    In our coding programs, students learn to think like programmers as they 
    explore programming languages. Developing algorithmic thinking is at the 
    core all of our classes, regardless of the student's age or experience.
</p>  
<p>
    <b>Robotics.</b>
    Our robotics classes bring engineering and programming to life. Students 
    build and program their own robots, learning about mechanics, electronics, 
    and automation. These classes encourage teamwork, innovation, and practical 
    applications of STEM concepts.
