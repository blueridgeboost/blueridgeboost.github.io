This class is perfect for students who are new to creating games in Roblox. 

We will teach you how to create your first Roblox experience using Roblox Studio. You will use a Baseplate template and a high-quality catapult asset pack to build and organize a data model, customize 3D objects, and organize scripts for proper simulation. We will guide you through testing, publishing, and managing your experience for a global audience, using project templates and asset packs from the Creator Store to simplify the process.
