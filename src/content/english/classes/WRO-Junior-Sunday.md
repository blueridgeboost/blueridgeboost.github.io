<p><strong></strong></p><p>This course focuses on Mars exploration and colonization, where students will design, build, and program robots to tackle challenges inspired by real-world missions to the Red Planet. Participants will complete tasks such as collecting resources, assisting rovers, and navigating challenging terrain. The course emphasizes robotics, engineering, and problem-solving while fostering creativity and teamwork.</p><hr><h4><strong>Learning Objectives</strong></h4><p>By the end of this course, students will:</p><ol> <li>Understand how robots play a critical role in space exploration, particularly for Mars missions.</li> <li>Learn to program robots to complete specific tasks on a game field designed to simulate Mars exploration.</li> <li>Develop skills in precision, strategic thinking, and teamwork while solving real-world-inspired challenges.</li> <li>Apply robotics concepts to support scenarios involving transportation, resource collection, and environmental navigation.</li> </ol><hr><h4><strong>Key Activities</strong></h4><p>Students will program their robots to complete the following missions on a simulated Mars-themed game field:</p><ol> <li><strong>Collect the Drone</strong> <ul> <li>Retrieve a drone located on the game field and bring it to the starting area.</li> <li>Learn about precision navigation and object handling.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Help the Stranded Rover</strong> <ul> <li>Unfold the solar panel of a stranded Mars rover while ensuring it remains in its designated area.</li> <li>Practice robotic mechanisms and precise positioning.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Support Research on Mars</strong> <ul> <li>Collect research samples and transport them to their corresponding color-coded research labs.</li> <li>Work on object recognition and placement accuracy.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Water Supply</strong> <ul> <li>Transport water tanks into a designated box to simulate water supply management on Mars.</li> <li>Explore transportation and containment mechanisms.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Cross Rough Terrain</strong> <ul> <li>Navigate through challenging terrain and park the robot in a target area.</li> <li>Master obstacle navigation and precision control.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Bonus for Rocks and Barriers</strong> <ul> <li>Avoid moving or damaging rocks and barriers on the field.</li> <li>Reinforce attention to detail and obstacle avoidance techniques.</li> </ul> </li> </ol><hr><h4><strong>Scoring System</strong></h4><p>Students will evaluate their robot's performance based on specific scoring criteria:</p><ul> <li><strong>Drone Collection</strong>: <ul> <li>Completely in the start area: <strong>10 points</strong>.</li> <li>Partly in the start area: <strong>5 points</strong>.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Rover Assistance</strong>: <ul> <li>Solar panel unfolded, and rover still touching its area: <strong>10 points</strong>.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Research Samples</strong>: <ul> <li>Correct lab and completely inside: <strong>15 points</strong> per sample (maximum of <strong>60 points</strong>).</li> <li>Touching any lab or wrong-colored lab: <strong>10 points</strong>.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Water Supply</strong>: <ul> <li>Each water tank in the box: <strong>20 points</strong> (maximum of <strong>40 points</strong>).</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Rough Terrain</strong>: <ul> <li>Robot completely in the target area: <strong>12 points</strong>.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Bonus for Rocks and Barriers</strong>: <ul> <li>Barriers intact and unmoved: <strong>8 points</strong> each (maximum of <strong>16 points</strong>).</li> <li>Rocks intact and unmoved: <strong>3 points</strong> each (maximum of <strong>18 points</strong>).</li> </ul> </li> </ul><p>The maximum achievable score is <strong>166 points</strong> per round.</p><hr><h4><strong>Special Event</strong></h4><p><strong>Blue Ridge Boost</strong> will host a <strong>friendly competition at the beginning of June</strong>, where students will test their robots in a simulated Mars exploration environment. This event provides an opportunity to practice, collaborate, and gain valuable experience in a fun, supportive setting.</p><hr><h4><strong>Course Features</strong></h4><ul> <li><strong>Flexible Mission Execution</strong>: Students can tackle missions in any order, encouraging creativity and strategy.</li> <li><strong>Mars-Themed Challenges</strong>: Real-world-inspired tasks make the learning experience exciting and engaging.</li> <li><strong>Beginner and Advanced-Friendly</strong>: The course accommodates students with varying robotics experience levels, offering both simple and complex challenges.</li> <li><strong>Competitive and Collaborative Environment</strong>: Students will prepare for local, national, and potential international competitions.</li> </ul><hr><h4><strong>Additional Notes</strong></h4><ul> <li>The course aligns with the <strong>WRO RoboMission General Rules</strong> to ensure consistency with competition standards.</li> <li>A <strong>surprise mission</strong> will be introduced for the <strong>WRO International Final</strong> (released on October 8, 2025). This mission is not mandatory for class participation.</li> </ul><hr><h4><strong>Who Should Enroll?</strong></h4><p>This course is ideal for students aged 11–15 who are interested in robotics, programming, and STEM challenges. No prior robotics experience is required, though basic programming skills are helpful.</p><hr><h4><strong>What Students Will Gain</strong></h4><ul> <li>A deeper understanding of robotics’ applications in space exploration and colonization.</li> <li>Hands-on experience with engineering design, programming, and problem-solving.</li> <li>Skills in teamwork, precision, and strategy.</li> <li>An opportunity to compete in WRO events, including local, national, and international stages.</li> </ul><hr><p>This course is an exciting journey into the future of space exploration! Join us to develop your robotics skills, explore Mars, and prepare for friendly competitions like <strong>Blue Ridge Boost in June</strong>!</p>
