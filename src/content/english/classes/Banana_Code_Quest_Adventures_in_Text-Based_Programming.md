<h4>Key Features</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Real Coding Language</strong>: Students will code using CoffeeScript, a language similar to JavaScript but with a friendlier syntax, making it perfect for kids.</li>
    <li><strong>Fun-Filled Challenges</strong>: The course includes a series of puzzles where students write code to help the monkey achieve various tasks.</li>
    <li><strong>Structured Learning</strong>: The course is divided into three parts:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Part 1: Fundamentals</strong> – Introduces the basics of coding.</li>
            <li><strong>Part 2: Functions & Conditions</strong> – Covers more advanced concepts.</li>
            <li><strong>Part 3: Logic & Events</strong> – Wraps up with complex coding challenges.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>Coding Concepts Covered</h4>
<p>Students will learn a variety of coding concepts, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Objects</strong>: Essential for organizing and storing data in a structured way.</li>
    <li><strong>Loops</strong>: Crucial for executing repetitive tasks efficiently.</li>
    <li><strong>Variables</strong>: Fundamental for storing and manipulating data within a program.</li>
    <li><strong>Array Indexing</strong>: Important for accessing and manipulating data stored in arrays.</li>
    <li><strong>Functions</strong>: Key for creating reusable code blocks, making programs more modular and manageable.</li>
    <li><strong>Boolean Logic</strong>: Necessary for decision-making processes within code, using true/false values.</li>
    <li><strong>Comparisons</strong>: Important for evaluating conditions and making decisions based on different criteria.</li>
    <li><strong>Return Values</strong>: Essential for functions to output data and interact with other parts of the program.</li>
    <li><strong>Triggering Events</strong>: Key for creating interactive applications that respond to user actions or other events.</li>
    <li>And more!</li>
</ul>
