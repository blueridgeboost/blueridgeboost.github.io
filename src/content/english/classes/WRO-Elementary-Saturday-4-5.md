<p><strong></strong></p><p>The 2025 challenge focuses on the importance of satellites, their use in daily life (e.g., communication, GPS, and weather forecasting), and the role of AI and robots in space debris cleanup and satellite deployment. Teams are tasked with programming robots to perform missions related to satellites and space debris.</p><hr><h3><strong>Game Field Overview</strong></h3><ul> <li>The game field includes various mission areas such as rocket fuel, launch pad, satellite orbits, space debris, astronauts, and a barrier.</li> <li>Randomization occurs for satellite placement in each round: <ul> <li>4 satellites (out of 5) are placed on the field.</li> <li>1 satellite is left out each round.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Fixed elements (e.g., rocket fuel, space debris, astronauts, and barrier) are always in the same position.</li> </ul><hr><h3><strong>Robot Missions</strong></h3><ol> <li><strong>Fuel the Rocket</strong>: <ul> <li>Transport rocket fuel from the starting area to the rocket fuel area.</li> <li>Scoring: <ul> <li>Completely in the fuel area: <strong>10 points</strong>.</li> <li>Partly touching the fuel area: <strong>5 points</strong>.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Launch the Rocket</strong>: <ul> <li>Push the rocket along the rail to simulate a launch into space.</li> <li>Scoring: <ul> <li>Rocket beyond 2nd red marker: <strong>15 points</strong>.</li> <li>Rocket beyond 1st red marker (but not the 2nd): <strong>5 points</strong>.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Collect Satellites and Place Them in Orbits</strong>: <ul> <li>Identify and transport satellites to their corresponding colored orbits.</li> <li>Scoring: <ul> <li>Satellite completely in the correct orbit: <strong>20 points</strong>.</li> <li>Satellite partly in any orbit or in the wrong-colored orbit: <strong>5 points</strong>.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Collect Space Debris</strong>: <ul> <li>Bring 3 pieces of space debris back to the start area.</li> <li>Scoring: <ul> <li>Each piece touching the start area: <strong>10 points</strong> (maximum of <strong>30 points</strong>).</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Bonus for Astronauts and Barrier</strong>: <ul> <li>Ensure the astronauts and barrier are not moved or damaged during the mission.</li> <li>Scoring: <ul> <li>Each astronaut not moved or damaged: <strong>5 points</strong>.</li> <li>Barrier not moved or damaged: <strong>10 points</strong>.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ol><hr><h3><strong>Scoring Overview</strong></h3><ul> <li>Maximum score per round: <strong>155 points</strong>.</li> <li>Missions can be completed in any order.</li> <li>Bonus points are awarded for preserving the astronauts and barrier.</li> <li>Only the highest-scoring satellite in each orbit counts.</li></ul><hr> <h4><strong>Who Should Enroll?</strong></h4> <p>This course is ideal for students aged 8–12 who are interested in robotics, programming, and STEM challenges. No prior robotics experience is required, though familiarity with basic programming concepts is helpful.</p> <hr> <h4><strong>What Students Will Gain</strong></h4> <ul> <li>A deeper understanding of robotics and AI applications in solving global challenges.</li> <li>Hands-on experience with engineering design and programming.</li> <li>Teamwork, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills.</li> <li>An opportunity to compete in WRO events and showcase their work on an international stage.</li> </ul> <hr> <p>This course is a fun, educational journey into the world of robotics and space exploration! Join us to build, program, and innovate for the future of satellites and sustainable space exploration! Don’t miss the <strong>Blue Ridge Boost friendly competition in June</strong> to kick off your robotics journey!</p>
