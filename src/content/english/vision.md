## History of Blue Ridge Boost
During the COVID-19 pandemic, I spent a significant amount of time teaching and helping my children learn, and I discovered that I greatly enjoy teaching young students. This newfound passion led me to quit my Ph.D. program in Computer Science to pursue a degree in teaching at the University of Virginia, and I subsequently launched Blue Ridge Boost.

During the lockdown, Maxwell and Dorina enrolled in various challenging and exciting classes offered by the Center for Talented Youth at Johns Hopkins and The Art of Problem Solving. Despite the quality of the instructors, the lack of face-to-face interaction was a significant drawback.

In 2021, I founded Blue Ridge Boost as an affordable, in-person alternative to expensive online courses for advanced students seeking challenging content. I began by offering math and coding tutoring, both online and in person, from my home for advanced high school and college students. After graduating in 2022, I expanded Blue Ridge Boost to provide in-person coding classes for elementary and middle school students at our Downtown office. 

In June 2023, after spending a year as an Algebra teacher at the Peabody School, I decided to dedicate all my attention and energy to Blue Ridge Boost. Later that year, we expanded our office and course offerings to include math and robotics classes. In February 2024, we moved to our current location to expand the number of classes and camp size we offer.

## Mission

Blue Ridge Boost stands out from other educational institutions because it provides affordable year-round education in computer coding, robotics, and math. This unique approach allows students to engage with these subjects consistently, fostering a deeper understanding and long-term skill development.

The coding classes offered by Blue Ridge Boost are meticulously chosen or designed to teach students core coding concepts. These classes are carefully developed and selected by experienced educators and engineers, ensuring that the curriculum is comprehensive, up-to-date, and aligned with industry standards. By learning fundamental coding concepts, students gain a solid foundation that can be applied to various programming languages and technologies. 

In addition to coding education, Blue Ridge Boost places a strong emphasis on math instruction. The math classes provided by the institution focus on fostering a deep understanding of mathematical concepts rather than relying solely on rote memorization. This approach encourages students to think critically, solve problems creatively, and develop independent learning skills. By becoming independent learners, students are better equipped to tackle complex mathematical challenges and apply their knowledge in practical contexts.

Blue Ridge Boost goes beyond classroom instruction to support its community of learners. The institution hosts the Charlottesville Kids' Chess Club, providing a space for students to learn and enjoy the game of chess. Chess is known for its cognitive benefits, such as enhancing critical thinking, concentration, and strategic planning skills. By offering this club, Blue Ridge Boost promotes holistic development and encourages students to engage in activities that complement their academic pursuits.

Blue Ridge Boost owner, Nora Evans, is passionate about increasing the participation of girls and women in engineering. Blue Ridge Boost proudly takes the <a href="chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://recf.org/documents/2020/09/girl-powered-pledge.pdf/">Girl Powered Pledge</a> and organizes a series free Introductory Girl Powered Workshops on select Saturday evenings. Girls are encouraged to participate in the Girl Powered competition preparation classes.

Recognizing that financial constraints can hinder access to quality education, Blue Ridge Boost takes proactive steps to address this issue. The institution offers several scholarships to students with financial need, ensuring that deserving individuals have the opportunity to benefit from their educational programs. These scholarships open doors for talented students who might otherwise be unable to pursue coding and math education due to financial limitations. By providing financial assistance, Blue Ridge Boost demonstrates its commitment to inclusivity, equal opportunity, and empowering students from diverse backgrounds.

In summary, Blue Ridge Boost's unique attributes lie in its affordable year-round education in coding and individual math instruction. The institution's coding classes, created by experienced educators and engineers, teach core concepts and provide students with practical coding skills. The math instruction emphasizes understanding and independent learning. By hosting the Charlottesville Kids' Chess Club and offering scholarships to students with financial need, Blue Ridge Boost further enriches the educational experience and supports its community of learners.
