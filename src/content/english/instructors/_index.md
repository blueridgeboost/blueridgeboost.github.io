  bio: "Ransford is originally from Koforidua, Ghana. He moved to Charlottesville, Virginia with his parents as an infant. Currently, Ransford is working towards an Associate's Degree in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science.
  
  Ransford has experience in teaching teens and kids how to code. Through NSBE (National Society of Black Engineers) and Mrs. Early from Albemarle High School, Ranford taught middle schoolers to code a Sphero bots. He helped students to understand critical thinking and problem-solving skills to be able to guide the Sphero out of not just one maze but an array of mazes with the same code.
  
  At Blue Ridge Boost, Ransford teaches coding and robotics classes for elementary and middle school students both in classes and camp. Ransford also serves as coordinator for camps.
