## Accepted Payment Methods
Blue Ridge Boost LLC accepts the following payment methods:
1. Credit Cards (Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover)
2. Debit Cards
3. Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT)
4. Checks (personal or cashier's)

## Payment Due Date
All payments for classes are due upon registration. Your child's spot in the class will not be reserved until payment is received in full. Subscriptions will be charged on the current date. Future payments will be drawn at the beginning of each month, starting with the second class.

## Recurring Payments (Subscriptions)
For your convenience, we offer subscription-based enrollment. By enrolling in a subscription, you authorize Blue Ridge Boost LLC to automatically charge your chosen payment method on a recurring basis (e.g., monthly or quarterly). Subscription payments will be processed on the same day of each billing period.

## Returned Checks and Insufficient Funds
If a check is returned due to insufficient funds or any other reason, a $25 fee will be assessed. You will be notified of the returned check and the outstanding balance, which must be paid within 10 business days. Failure to pay the outstanding balance may result in your child's dismissal from the program.

## Late Payments
If payment is not received by the due date, a late fee of $25 will be assessed. If payment is not received within 10 business days of the due date, your child may be dismissed from the program.

## Refunds
Refunds will be issued in accordance with our Refunds and Cancellations policy outlined in the Terms and Conditions. In the event of a refund, the original payment method will be credited.

## Subscription Cancellation
You may cancel your subscription at any time. However, no refund will be issued for the remaining portion of the current payment period. Cancellations must be submitted in writing at least 10 business days prior to the next billing date to avoid being charged for the upcoming period.

## Price Changes
Blue Ridge Boost LLC reserves the right to adjust class prices at any time. You will be notified of any price changes at least 30 days in advance. If you do not wish to continue with the new pricing, you may cancel your enrollment or subscription in accordance with our cancellation policy.
