## General Policy: No Refunds
We maintain a strict no-refund policy for all sales. This policy applies to, but is not limited to, the following situations:

1. Customer-initiated enrollment cancellations
2. Missed events due to student absence
3. Program or instructor dissatisfaction
4. Dismissal resulting from conduct violations

While we do not offer refunds, we value your feedback. We are committed to continuously improving our programs to meet your expectations. If you have concerns or suggestions, please don't hesitate to share them with us.

## Transfers
While we do not offer refunds, we understand that circumstances may change. 
If you need to modify your child's enrollment, you may request a transfer to a similar activity, subject to the following conditions:
- Transfers must be requested in writing at least 10 business days prior to the start of the original activity.
- Transfers are subject to availability in the desired activity.
- The activity to which you are transferring must be of equal or lesser value than the original activity.
- If the new activity is of lesser value, no refund will be issued for the price difference.
- If the new activity is of greater value, you will be responsible for paying the difference in price.


## Subscription Cancellation
Subscriptions may be cancelled by the customer. No refunds are given for the charges already made.

## Subscription Transfers
If your child is enrolled in a subscription and you wish to transfer to a different activity, the following additional conditions apply:
- The transfer will take effect at the start of the next billing cycle.
- No prorated refunds or credits will be issued for the current billing cycle.

## Cancelled Events
In the event that Blue Ridge Boost LLC cancels a event due to unforeseen circumstances (e.g., instructor illness, inclement weather, facility issues), we will make every effort to reschedule the event. If rescheduling is not possible, a refund will be issued for the value of the cancelled event. 

## Exceptions
<b>Exceptions to this policy may be made at the sole discretion of Blue Ridge Boost LLC. Such exceptions will be determined on a case-by-case basis and will require approval from a company director.</b>
