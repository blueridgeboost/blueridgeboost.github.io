If you cancel your child's enrollment more than 14 days before the start of the class, you will receive a full refund minus a $50 processing fee. If you cancel 14 days or less before the start of the class, no refund will be issued. The Company reserves the right to cancel a class for any reason. If the Company cancels a class, you will receive a full refund.

## General Policy
All sales are final. No refunds will be issued for any reason, including but not limited to:

1. Cancellation of enrollment by the customer 
2. Missed classes due to student absence
3. Dissatisfaction with the program or instructors
4. Dismissal from the program due to conduct violations

## Class Transfers
While we do not offer refunds, we understand that circumstances may change. If you need to modify your child's enrollment, you may request a transfer to a similar class, subject to the following conditions:
- Transfers must be requested in writing at least 10 business days prior to the start of the original class.
- Transfers are subject to availability in the desired class.
- The class to which you are transferring must be of equal or lesser value than the original class.
- If the new class is of lesser value, no refund will be issued for the price difference.
- If the new class is of greater value, you will be responsible for paying the difference in price.
- Each enrollment may only be transferred once.

## Subscription Transfers
If your child is enrolled in a subscription and you wish to transfer to a different class, the following additional conditions apply:
- The new class must be part of the same subscription program (e.g., monthly or quarterly).
- The transfer will take effect at the start of the next billing cycle.
- No prorated refunds or credits will be issued for the current billing cycle.

## Cancelled Classes
In the event that Blue Ridge Boost LLC cancels a class due to unforeseen circumstances (e.g., instructor illness, inclement weather, facility issues), we will make every effort to reschedule the class. If rescheduling is not possible, a credit will be issued for the value of the cancelled class. This credit may be applied towards future classes or subscription payments.

## Exceptions
In rare cases, exceptions to this policy may be made at the sole discretion of Blue Ridge Boost LLC. Such exceptions will be determined on a case-by-case basis and will require approval from a company director.

By enrolling your child in classes provided by Blue Ridge Boost LLC, you acknowledge and agree to this no refund policy. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact our office prior to enrolling.
