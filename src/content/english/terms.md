1. Enrollment
By enrolling your child in classes provided by Blue Ridge Boost LLC ("the Company"), you agree to these terms and conditions. The Company reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.
2. Age Requirements
Children must be at least six years old to participate in drop-off classes.
3. Day-Care License Program Exemption
Blue Ridge Boost LLC offers a program of instructional experience in a single focus area, including robotics, computer coding, math, and chess. As such, we are exempt from day care state licensure requirements, provided that children under the age of six do not attend at all and no child is allowed to attend for more than 25 days in any three-month period commencing with enrollment. This exemption does not apply if children merely change their enrollment to a different focus area at our site and their total attendance exceeds 25 days in a three-month period.
4. Attendance Limits
Each child may attend a maximum of 25 days of classes within any three-month period, commencing with their enrollment date. This limit is in place to ensure that all children have equal access to our services and to maintain our exemption from licensure under state law.
5. Payment and Subscriptions
All classes must be paid for in advance. Payment is due upon registration. The Company accepts payment by credit card, debit card, or electronic funds transfer. Returned checks will incur a $25 fee. Subscriptions can be cancelled at any time; however, no refund will be issued for the remaining portion of the current payment period.
6. Refunds and Cancellations
All sales are final. The Company reserves the right to cancel a class for any reason. If the Company cancels a class, you will receive a full refund.
7. Attendance
Students are expected to attend all classes for which they are enrolled. No refunds or make-up classes will be offered for missed classes. If your child is unable to attend a class, please notify the Company as soon as possible.
8. Conduct
Students are expected to behave respectfully towards instructors, staff, and other students. The Company reserves the right to dismiss any student whose behavior is disruptive or inappropriate. No refund will be issued in such cases.
9. Liability Waiver
By enrolling your child, you agree to release, waive, discharge, and hold harmless Blue Ridge Boost LLC, its instructors, staff, and representatives from any and all liability, claims, demands, actions, and causes of action related to any loss, damage, or injury that may be sustained by your child while participating in classes.
10. Media Release
The Company reserves the right to use, reproduce, and/or publish photographs and/or video that may pertain to your child, including their image, likeness and/or voice without compensation.
