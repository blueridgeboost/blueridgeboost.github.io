    monday: "Astronomical Model. In order to precisely measure time on Earth, people have been observing the movement of Sun and Moon. Learn the ancient method of determining time and count the passing with the help of built-in color sensor."
    tuesday: "Cosmic Chase. Organize a race of two starfighters right on your desk. You‚Äôll build the entire construction from scratch, yet you won‚Äôt be able to predict the outcome of this race. How come? Randomness at work."
    wednesday: "Moon Lander. What‚Äôs so difficult about landing on celestial bodies? Create your own lander to find out what were the main challenges to landing on the Moon and learn about the most famous landing in the man‚Äôs history executed by Apollo 11."
    thursday: "Space Shuttle. Become a shuttle pilot for a day and learn what dangers await astronauts in space. Start with printing a map to the stars, build your space flight simulator, activate it with code and make sure to avoid obstacles in front of you."
    friday: "Planetary Walker. Examine unknown surface from a safe distance. Hop on the surface walker, which steadily advances forward - unless there‚Äôs an obstacle in its way. Can you think of an animal that walks in a similar manner?"

    monday: "Satellite. What are people actually doing on the Earth‚Äôs orbit? And what exactly is a satellite? Learn all about it by building a model featuring a space shuttle, a satellite, and a rotating base. Next: code it and make them spin!"
    tuesday: "Mars Rover. Inspired by the famous Curiosity rover, this robot will be your guide to Mars. It‚Äôs well equipped for it, too: it‚Äôs movement is slow and accurate, it has rotating sensors and an adjustable arm. Are you ready for this mission?"
    wednesday: "Robotic Arm. Great strength paired with great precision is sometimes beyond humans‚Äô reach. That‚Äôs where robots step in. Build and program a robotic arm to learn how high-tech machines aid people in laboratories, warehouses, or in space"
    thursday: "Droid. Your friendly automaton would like to go on a space walk. Make it happen by assembling its gear transmission and creating the activation program, then find out what inspires modern engineers to design new robots."
    friday: "Space Fighter. Maneuver through the Milky Way and reach the end of galaxy onboard this amazing fighter. Although it‚Äôs not doable in real life yet, it wouldn‚Äôt be the first time science fiction influenced the imagination of real-life engineers."
