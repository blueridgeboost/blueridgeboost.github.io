  monday: '<a href="https://education.vex.com/stemlabs/go/simple-machines">Simple Machines STEM Lab Unit, Lab 1</a>.<br>Students will use the VEX GO Kit to construct an inclined plane with three height levels and examine how height and gravity influence the travel distance of an object rolling down. They will measure the distance the VEX GO Blue Wheel covers after descending the plane at each height. Additionally, they will make predictions using data from prior experiments and demonstrations.<br> Extension Activities: <a href="https://education.vex.com/stemlabs/go/simple-machines/unit-overview/choice-board">Simple Machines Choice Board</a> &ndash; Photographer and Engineer.</a><br>'
  tuesday: '<a href="https://education.vex.com/stemlabs/go/simple-machines">Simple Machines STEM Lab Unit, Lab 2 and 3</a>.<br>In Lab 2, campers will construct and test a Lever using the VEX GO Kit to discover how a lever reduces the force required to lift an object, thus making work easier. Additionally, they will investigate how adjusting the pivot point affects the force needed to balance each side of the Lever.<br>In Lab 3, campers will construct a Spring Car using the GO Kit and explore how a wheel and axle facilitate easier movement. They will analyze how this mechanism impacts the travel distance. Using collected data, campers will make predictions and identify cause-and-effect relationships regarding how the wheel and axle help an object move more effortlessly.<br>Extension Activities: <a href="https://education.vex.com/stemlabs/go/simple-machines/unit-overview/choice-board">Simple Machines Choice Board</a> &ndash; Create a Cartoon Strip, Collage; <a href="https://content.vexrobotics.com/assets/education/stem-labs/docs/go/Activities/GO%20Activity%20-%20Equation%20Balancer.pdf">Equation Balancer</a>, <a href="https://content.vexrobotics.com/assets/education/stem-labs/docs/go/Activities/GO%20Activity%20-%20Design%20a%20Novel%20Diorama.pdf">Design a Novel Diorama</a>.'
  wednesday: '<a href="https://education.vex.com/stemlabs/go/simple-machines">Simple Machines STEM Lab Unit, Lab 4</a>.<br>In Lab 4, campers will examine how energy is transferred through gears. They will assemble a hand-powered clock using the VEX GO Kit, observing the interactions among gears to understand how one impacts another. Additionally, campers will observe and use the patterns in gear movements to forecast the behavior of the final gear.<br>Extension Activities: <a href="https://education.vex.com/stemlabs/go/simple-machines/unit-overview/choice-board">Simple Machines Choice Board</a> &ndash; Scavenger Hunt and Poem.</a>'
  thursday: '<a href="https://education.vex.com/stemlabs/go/robot-arm">Robot Arm</a>, Labs 1 and 3.<br>Students will use VEXcode GO to control the movement of the Robot Arm, to try to move it to each of the 4 quadrants of the tile.<br>Students will code the Robot Arm to move a disk, using the Electromagnet, to a new location on the tile.'
  friday: '<a href="https://education.vex.com/stemlabs/go/robot-arm">Robot Arm</a>, Lab 4.<br>Introduce the Eye Sensor by engaging in a discussion about how humans and robots see things. Compare and contrast the Eye Sensor to a human eye. Introduce the concept of a condition, and how a condition in coding helps tell what to do with a sensor’s data.<br>Students will code the Robot Arm to detect and move a disk, using the <Eye found object> block, to determine if something is in front of the Eye Sensor. At the Mid-Play Break, the teacher will talk about how to tell the Robot Arm what to do with the object it picked up.<brStudents will then code the Robot Arm to use both the Arm Motor and Base Motor to move the disk to a new location. During the Share portion, students will discuss what condition they used, and how the Eye Sensor made the Robot Arm more useful.'

    monday: '<a href="https://content.vexrobotics.com/assets/education/stem-labs/docs/go/Activities/GO%20Activity%20-%20Ramp%20Racers.pdf">Ramp Racers</a> &ndash; Modify the wheel on your VEX GO Inclined Plane and race a friend! Test out the effects of adding weight to the wheel on your inclined plane.<br> <a href="https://content.vexrobotics.com/assets/education/stem-labs/docs/go/Activities/GO%20Activity%20-%20Strike.pdf">Strike!</a> &ndash; Bowl using the VEX GO Inclined Plane. Use different pivot points on an incline plane to knock the most pins over.'
    tuesday: '<a href="https://content.vexrobotics.com/assets/education/stem-labs/docs/go/Activities/GO%20Activity%20-%20Tallest%20Tower%20Challenge.pdf">Tallest Tower Activity</a> &ndash; Can you build the tallest freestanding tower using the same 10 pieces?<br> <a href="https://content.vexrobotics.com/assets/education/stem-labs/docs/go/Activities/GO%20Activity%20-%20Build%20It%20Make%20It%20Engineer%20It.pdf">Build it, Make it, Engineer it</a> &ndash; Can you build a house? Will it stay up during a windstorm?'
    wednesday: '<a href="https://content.vexrobotics.com/assets/education/stem-labs/docs/go/Activities/GO%20Activity%20-%20Astronaut%20Rescue.pdf">Astronaut Rescue Activity</a> &nbsp; The VEX GOAstronaut has fallen into a crater and needs your help! Use your design skills to create a rescue mechanism using a pulley to lift the astronaut out of the crater and back to safety!<br><a href="https://content.vexrobotics.com/assets/education/stem-labs/docs/go/Activities/GO%20Activity%20-%20Wheel%20and%20Axle%20Lunar%20Rover.pdf">Wheel and Axle Lunar Rover Activity</a> &ndash; Design a Lunar Rover that will need to have an axle and wheel to drive on the moon. Use as many axles and wheels as you need.'
    thursday: '<a href="https://content.vexrobotics.com/assets/education/stem-labs/docs/go/Activities/GO%20Activity%20Series%20-%20Super%20Bowler.pdf">Super Bowler</a>. &ndash; What happens when we pull back or stretch, a rubber band? What happens when we release it? The distance that the rubber band travels depends on how much or how little we stretch it, right? Why do you think that is? (You may want to demonstrate this with a household rubber band.) Today we are going to build a car that is powered by a rubber band. We are going to explore this idea of using a rubber band to power a car, by building and experimenting with a VEX GO Slingshot Car! The Slingshot Car is a machine that is powered by the tension in a rubber band. First, we are going to build the Slingshot Car with our VEX GO Kits, and test the build to see how it works. Then, we will experiment with pulling the car back different distances to create more or less tension in the rubber band, to see how that changes the movement of the Slingshot Car. Finally, we will use what we’ve learned to play a bowling game with the Slingshot Car!'
    friday: '<a href="https://education.vex.com/stemlabs/go/robot-arm">Robot Arm</a>, Lab 5.<br>Students are introduce the idea of robotic decision making using chores in daily life. How do you know how to put away materials in the classroom? Or your clothes at home? Talk about how humans think to sort objects, but robots follow patterns to make decisions. How can we code the Robot Arm to make a decision? <br>Students will code the Robot Arm to identify and move one colored disk to a specific location, based on the color. At the Mid-Play Break, students will try to guess the Robot Arm’s “favorite color” based on the code. Then, they will test to see if they are right. <br>Students will then code the Robot Arm to identify and sort all three colored disks and move to specific locations based on color.  Students will discuss other objects the Robot Arm could sort, and make connections to real-world robots (like palletizing based on product, sensors, similar shapes/appearance).'
