description: "The Vex123 Move it! Shake it! camp provides a fun and educational experience where young students learn the basics of robotics and coding. The camp's activities include programming robots to navigate paths, creating dance sequences, and engaging in a dynamic bowling challenge. Through these activities, campers develop skills in motion control, creativity, problem-solving, and teamwork."

summary: "The adventure kicks off as students program their robots to navigate a predefined path, giving them their initial experience in motion control. The excitement builds as they delve into coding dance movements, transforming their robots into lively partying peacocks, showcasing their creativity and understanding of motion sequences.


The culmination of the program involves a dynamic bowling activity where students code the robot to knock down pins and even crash into a tower, applying their accumulated skills in a challenging and enjoyable way. This comprehensive approach not only teaches robotics and coding but also fosters creativity, problem-solving, and teamwork among the campers."
