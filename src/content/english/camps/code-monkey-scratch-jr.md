description: "A comprehensive learning experience, combining structured morning sessions using Code Monkey Jr with creative afternoon projects using PBS KIDS ScratchJr"

summary: "The coding camp offers a comprehensive learning experience, combining structured morning sessions using Code Monkey Jr with creative afternoon projects using PBS KIDS ScratchJr. Mornings focus on fundamental coding concepts, progressing from basic sequencing to loops, advanced loops, conditional looping, and procedures. Afternoons engage campers in themed projects inspired by popular PBS shows, exploring topics like animal abilities, odd patterns, plant growth, decision-making, and space exploration. This balanced approach allows children to build strong coding foundations while applying their skills to fun, interactive projects, fostering both technical knowledge and creativity throughout the week."

    monday: "Sequencing. Campers begin by understanding that coding involves giving precise instructions to a computer, exemplified through creating a simple dance routine. They then use the Code Monkeyâ„¢ platform to complete initial coding exercises, employing commands to move left and right. As they progress, they learn new commands and how to plan and code complex sequences. Eventually, they are introduced to additional commands, such as jump, and use their accumulated knowledge to solve increasingly complex problems."
    tuesday: "Loops. Campers first learn the importance of efficiency by evaluating multiple solutions to a problem. They then discover how to write concise code using loops to handle repetition. As they progress, they practice creating longer loops that contain two or more commands. Finally, they explore the concept of loop termination, understanding why some loops finish and others run indefinitely, touching on fundamental questions in theoretical computer science."
    wednesday: "Advanced Loops. Campers initially learn to plan their path by moving in one direction and then returning to reach a treasure chest. They continue practicing by deciding the optimal movements to collect all the bananas. As they advance, they code increasingly complex paths, refining their sequencing skills. Finally, in the Advanced Loops chapter, students enhance their understanding by adding commands before the loop, identifying patterns, and determining the starting point to guide the monkey effectively. "
    thursday: "Conditional Looping. Campers first identify patterns and commands that precede loops. They then code loops with three to four commands. Next, they explore conditional loops, which repeat based on conditions, and practice planning their sequences. In advanced conditional looping, students learn to create loops with two instructions, implement multiple loops in sequence, navigate using multiple loops, and apply conditional loops to various parts of their solution."
    friday: "Procedures. Campers first learn to write procedures and understand modular solutions. They then continue practicing procedure writing. As they progress, they use multiple, increasingly complex procedures in each challenge. Finally, they tackle advanced procedure challenges, validating paths and navigating in both directions to collect bananas and reach the treasure chest."
