description: "Code the 123 Robot for Mars-inspired challenges at Space Race Camp. Meet VEX, set rules, and complete missions like sample collection and object detection. Enhance coding skills through interactive space exploration scenarios."

summary: "In the Space Race Camp, campers meet “VEX,” the 123 Robot through a fun and interactive story and establish a set of rules and practices for working with the robot. Then, campers imagine their robot as a Mars rover and complete several missions including coding their robot to collect samples and return them to base camp for delivering to Earth. Then, campers will use the Eye Sensor to detect objects and clear the landing area for future missions.
In the afternoons, the campers use the Art Ring and craft materials to transform the Vex123 robot into a variety of animals."
