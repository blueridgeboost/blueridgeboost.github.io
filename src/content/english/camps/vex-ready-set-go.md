description: "Campers will engage in building and racing various cars to explore the concepts of forces and speed! They will start by constructing a Super Car and experimenting with ways to enhance its distance and speed. Over the course of the camp, they will expand on this foundation by assembling different models of the Super Car. This progression will allow them to investigate the dynamics of how these models move, culminating in coding and operating both the Code Super Car and the Code Base."

  title: "Morning"
  monday: '<a href="https://education.vex.com/stemlabs/go/super-car">Super Car</a>, Labs 1 and 2. Campers will build the Super Car. They will predict and measure the distance it will travel. Campers will investigate how the number of turns affects the speed of the Super Car.'
  tuesday: '<a href="https://education.vex.com/stemlabs/go/physical-science">Physical Science</a>, Labs 1 and 2. Force is a fundamental concept in physics that causes objects to move or change their motion. Students will explore force through experiments with a Super Car. They will first investigate gravitational force by launching the car from different heights on an inclined plane. Then, they will modify the car with a rubber band to study how changing the applied force affects the travel distance. These hands-on activities will help students understand what causes force, how it can be changed, and its effects on motion.'
  wednesday: '<a href="https://education.vex.com/stemlabs/go/physical-science">Physical Science</a>, Lab 4. The Steering Super Car utilizes the combined forces from two motors to achieve turning capability. Students will investigate how differential motor speeds and directions create the torque necessary for steering. By applying varying power to each motor, they will observe how the car can move forward, reverse, and turn left or right. This exploration will deepen their understanding of basic robotic movement principles. Students will analyze how the interplay of these motor forces affects the trajectory and stability. Through hands-on experimentation, they will learn to predict the motion based on motor input, developing their ability to anticipate continued motion, changes in direction, or maintenance of stability. This practical application of physics concepts will enhance their comprehension of force, motion, and robotics fundamentals.'
  thursday: '<a href="https://education.vex.com/stemlabs/go/parade-float">Parade Float</a>, Labs 1, 2, 3. Campers will build the Code Base robot and develop a VEXcode GO project to guide it through two challenge courses. They will design and construct a float to be placed atop the Code Base robot. After creating the float, campers will conduct tests to evaluate its stability when positioned on the robot. This hands-on project allows campers to apply their coding skills, enhance their engineering abilities, and gain practical experience in robot navigation and structural design. Through the process of building, programming, and testing, campers will develop problem-solving skills and learn to iterate on their designs for improved performance.'
  friday: '<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/19CCvurPXxXDaWvYok4_iTDp8aaC-4cDypiQkWw3h-Io/edit">Self-Driving Code Base</a>, part 1. Campers will explore two key functions of the Eye Sensor in their robotics projects. First, they will use the "Move Until Dark Line" example project to understand how the Eye Sensor detects lines, enabling their car to stay within its lane. This exercise demonstrates the ability of the sensor to distinguish brightness levels. Next, campers will create their own VEXcode GO project that utilizes the color detection capability. Their goal will be to program their car to stop when it encounters a stop sign, showcasing practical applications of color sensing in robotics. These activities will enhance understanding of sensor-based navigation and decision-making in autonomous vehicles.'

pm_session:
    title: "Afternoon"
    monday: '<a href="https://education.vex.com/stemlabs/go/super-car">Super Car</a>, Lab 3. Campers will learn that average speed is the relationship between total distance traveled and elapsed time and will calculatw the average speed of the Super Car.<a href="https://education.vex.com/stemlabs/go/parade-float">Parade Float</a>, Labs 1, 2, and 3.'
    tuesday: '<a href="https://education.vex.com/stemlabs/go/physical-science">Physical Science</a>, Lab 3, Motorized Super Car. Students will compare Motorized and Unpowered Super Car builds to understand how motors affect movement and performance. They will develop clear research questions about the impact of motorization. The students will collect and analyze data on car dynamics, identify patterns, and make predictions based on their observations. They will explore how different gear configurations influence movement and gain practical insights into mechanical advantage and efficiency. This hands-on project enhances critical thinking and scientific inquiry skills, bridging theory and application in powered systems.'
    wednesday: '<a href="https://education.vex.com/stemlabs/go/physical-science">Physical Science</a>, Lab 5. Students will build and test their car at four different velocities. They will use their Data Collection Sheet to record how far the Code Super Car travels in three seconds at four different velocities. '
    thursday: '<a href="https://education.vex.com/stemlabs/go/parade-float">Parade Float</a>, Labs 4 and 5. Campers will calculate and program the Code Base robot to drive and turn specific distances using motor blocks like [Spin for]. They will measure the distance per wheel rotation, then determine the rotations needed to cover a parade route. Campers will also calculate the wheel rotations required for accurate turns. This exercise combines mathematics with robotics, improving their programming precision and spatial reasoning skills.'
    friday: '<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/19CCvurPXxXDaWvYok4_iTDp8aaC-4cDypiQkWw3h-Io/edit">Self-Driving Code Base, part 2. In the Construction Zone challenge, campers will program the Code Base robot to navigate a simulated roadwork area. They will use the Eye Sensor to detect different colors representing various road conditions. Campers will code the robot to drive at normal speed, slow down, and come to a complete stop based on the colors it encounters. This exercise will teach campers how to implement conditional statements in their code, allowing the robot to make real-time decisions based on sensor input. By completing this challenge, campers will gain practical experience in creating responsive robotic systems and understand the principles behind automated traffic management.'
