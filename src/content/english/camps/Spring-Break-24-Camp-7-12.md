<p>Spend your spring break mastering the art of fabrication at <strong>Blue Ridge Boost’s Fabrication Foundations Camp</strong>! </p><p>This course provides students with hands-on experience in fabrication techniques and tools, focusing on creating functional components for robotics. Students will learn to measure, interpret technical drawings, and work with materials like acrylic, aluminum, and 3D-printed plastics. The course includes guided lessons, mini-challenges, and projects to build essential skills in cutting, drilling, filing, and assembling. By the end of the course, students will have created a fully functional chassis, motor mount, and sensor mount, gaining foundational skills for engineering and robotics.</p><div><div> <hr> <h3><strong>Unit 1: Chassis Plate Fabrication (Acrylic)</strong></h3> <p>In this unit, students will create a <strong>chassis plate</strong> from acrylic while learning basic fabrication skills:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Key Skills:</strong> Measuring, interpreting technical drawings, using hand tools, and checking measurement accuracy.</li> <li><strong>Lessons & Challenges:</strong> <ul> <li>Cutting acrylic and corners.</li> <li>Drilling holes and creating slots with precision.</li> <li>Mini-challenges to drill and make smaller slots.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Project:</strong> Build a completed chassis plate.</li> <li><strong>Assessment:</strong> Unit 1 Quiz.</li> </ul> <hr> <h3><strong>Unit 2: Motor Mount Fabrication (Aluminum)</strong></h3> <p>In this unit, students will fabricate <strong>motor mounts</strong> to attach motors to a chassis using aluminum. They will learn advanced fabrication skills, including bending and shaping.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Key Skills:</strong> Cutting, drilling, filing, creating curves, and bending aluminum with a bending die.</li> <li><strong>Lessons & Challenges:</strong> <ul> <li>Cutting and drilling aluminum.</li> <li>Creating rounded corners and curves.</li> <li>Mini-challenges for drilling and making precise shapes.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Project:</strong> Create a functional motor mount.</li> <li><strong>Assessment:</strong> Unit 2 Quiz.</li> </ul> <hr> <h3><strong>Unit 3: Sensor Mount Fabrication (3D Printing)</strong></h3> <p>This unit introduces students to <strong>3D printing</strong> by creating a sensor mount to properly position sensors on a robot.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Key Skills:</strong> 3D modeling, preparing models for printing, and using 3D printers.</li> <li><strong>Lessons & Challenges:</strong> <ul> <li>Introduction to 3D modeling software.</li> <li>Preparing, printing, and cleaning 3D models.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Project:</strong> Modify and print a sensor mount to align with the chassis.</li> <li><strong>Assessment:</strong> Unit 3 Quiz.</li> </ul> <hr> <h3><strong>Course Completion:</strong></h3> <p>By the end of the course, they will have gained foundational fabrication skills and created three functional components: a chassis plate, motor mount, and sensor mount. These projects prepare students for further engineering, robotics, and design exploration.</p></div></div> <h3><strong>Camp Details:</strong></h3> <ul> <li><strong>Location:</strong> Blue Ridge Boost</li> <li><strong>Dates:</strong> Spring Break (March 31 to April 4)</li> <li><strong>Time:</strong>  10:30 AM – 3:30 PM</li> <li><strong>Ages:</strong> 13–17 years old</li> </ul> <h3><strong>Why Join?</strong></h3> <p>This is more than just a camp—it’s an opportunity to gain foundational skills in fabrication while earning a <strong>certification that showcases your new expertise</strong>.
