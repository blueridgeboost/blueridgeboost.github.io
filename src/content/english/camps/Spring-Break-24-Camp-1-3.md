<h3>Scratch Coding Daily Activities Overview</h3>
<h4><strong>Day 1: Cat and Mouse - Intro to Scratch</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Learn the basics of Scratch, including sprites, motion blocks, variables, loops, and if statements.</li>
	<li>Create a simple game where a cat chases a mouse and earns points.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Concepts Covered:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Getting familiar with the Scratch interface</li>

	<li>Motion blocks and forever loops</li>
	<li>Using variables for scoring</li>
	<li>Designing sprites and backdrops</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Activity:</strong><br> Students will create their first game where a cat moves around the screen using arrow keys, chasing a mouse that moves to random positions when touched. Points will be added for each successful chase, and a timer will end the game.
</p>
<hr>
<h4><strong>Day 2: Picture Purrfect - Creative Costumes and Dragging</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Understand costumes, sprite cloning, and draggable objects.</li>
	<li>Create a dress-up game where students can customize characters, add pets, and switch backdrops.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Concepts Covered:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Costume design and modifications</li>
	<li>Cloning and draggable sprites</li>
	<li>Switching costumes and backdrops</li>
	<li>Adding interactivity with controls</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Activity:</strong><br> Students will create a dress-up game where they can switch costumes with clicks, add pets and accessories, and drag them around the screen. They‚Äôll also include instructions on how to play, using text sprites.
</p>
