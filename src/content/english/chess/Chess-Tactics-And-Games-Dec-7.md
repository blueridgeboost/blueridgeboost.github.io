I am originally from Austria and I have played chess since I was 6 years old. For the last 10 years I have been playing at the Charlottesville Chess Club. I focus on strategy, creativity & converting early advantages into wins. I strive to create a positive learning atmosphere, using examples as well as analyzing games to help you achieve your goals and enjoy the game.</blockquote>
