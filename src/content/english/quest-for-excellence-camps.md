    <p>All camps are held at Blue Ridge Boost, 2171 Ivy Rd, Charlottesville.</p>
  	<p>To accommodate busy summer schedules, we offer two convenient options:<br>

	<p>At Blue Ridge Boost, all instructors are fully certified through the Carnegie Mellon Robotics Academy, 
		ensuring top-tier robotics education for all participants. Plus, as part of your camp experience, 
		taking the certification exam is included in the camp costâ€”providing a valuable opportunity to earn an 
		industry-recognized credential while having fun learning robotics and coding!</p>
	<p>The SMART Robotics Technician courses, developed by the Carnegie Mellon Robotics Academy, are  
		endorsed by the ARM Institute, ensuring they meet industry standards and address workforce demands. 
		These credentials are not only widely recognized but also formally qualify and hold approval from the 
		Virginia Department of Education, making them a valuable stepping stone for students pursuing careers 
		in robotics and advanced manufacturing.</p>
	<p>To earn the SMART Robotics Certification, a student must complete five different SMART Robotics Technician 
		micro-certifications and achieve a score of at least 70% on each course's final exam.</p>
	<p>If a student finishes a micro-certification course before the allotted camp time ends, they are eligible to begin another course immediately.</p>
