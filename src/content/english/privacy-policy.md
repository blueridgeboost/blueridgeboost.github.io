Blue Ridge Boost LLC ("Blue Ridge Boost," "we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting the privacy of the children enrolled in our classes and their parents/guardians. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and disclose personal information through the use of Ring video cameras in our classrooms. By enrolling your child in our classes, you consent to the practices described in this policy.

## Information Collection
To ensure the safety and security of the children in our care, we use Ring video cameras to monitor and record activity in our classrooms during class sessions. The video footage may capture the name, likeness, image, voice, and actions of children, staff, and visitors present in the classroom.

The personal information we collect may include:

1. Child's name, date of birth, and photograph
2. Parent/guardian's name, address, email address, and phone number
3. Emergency contact information
4. Relevant medical information (allergies, medical conditions, etc.)
5. Attendance records
6. Video footage from classroom monitoring
7. We only collect personal information necessary to provide our services, ensure child safety, and comply with legal requirements. We do not collect any personal information directly from children.

## Use of Information
The personal information and video footage collected is used for the following purposes:

1. To monitor the safety and well-being of children in our care
2. To maintain security in our facilities
3. To provide updates and communicate with parents/guardians
4. To aid in the training and professional development of our staff
5. To support the administration of our services
6. We do not use personal information or video footage for any other purposes without parental consent, unless required by law.

## Disclosure of Information
Blue Ridge Boost maintains strict confidentiality of the personal information collected. We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer personal information to outside parties. However, we may disclose information in the following circumstances:

1. With parental consent
2. To comply with a court order or other legal process
3. To protect the rights, property, or safety of Blue Ridge Boost, our staff, students, or others
4. To address emergencies impacting the health and safety of a child
5. To outside services providers who need access to fulfill responsibilities on our behalf and are bound by confidentiality obligations

## Data Security
We take reasonable measures to protect personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. Ring video footage is securely stored and encrypted. Access is limited to authorized staff and footage is automatically deleted after a set retention period.

## Your Rights and Choices
As a parent/guardian, you have the right to request access to your child's information, request corrections, or withdraw consent for the collection of personal information, subject to legal requirements. If you have any questions, please contact us using the information provided below.
