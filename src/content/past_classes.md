### Introduction to Coding

At Blue Ridge Boost, we teach the same fundamental coding concepts to students of all ages. The courses are structured around three 6-class sessions. Students may choose the starting point based on their prior exposure to coding. Topics included at each level are:
1. The concept of program and algorithm, sequential execution and simple loops.
2. Conditional loops and basic applications.
3. Avanced control structures and sorting algorithms.

The same coding concepts are presented at an age-appropriate level and programming language. Lower elementary school age students students learn a block programming language, upper-elementary students learm Coffee Script (an easy-to-learn first programming language that runs in your web browser), and the middle school students and high school students learn Python, a programming language widely used in industry. 

Each session consists of a lesson and practice time under the guidance of the instructor. Students are encouraged to use the platform to practice at home between sessions. The platform depends on the student's interest and abilities. Each student is provided with an account on one of the following platforms: [Code Monkey](https://www.codemonkey.com/), [Codesters](https://www.codesters.com/), or [Brilliant](https://brilliant.org/).

### Preparation for AP Computer Science

Each session is designed for your student's needs and goals.

### Math review and getting ahead

Each session is designed for your student's needs and goals. We teach math using a problem solving approach with topics and problems selected from [Art of Problem Solving](https://artofproblemsolving.com/) and math contests. Besides traditional problem solving, we present the student with visual approaches to build intuition.

### Preparation for AP Calculus

Review and learn concepts needed for calculus readiness.
