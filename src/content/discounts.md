<div class="container p-5">

At Blue Ridge Boost, we value your children's thirst for knowledge and desire to learn. We introduce two discount codes that can be used with all our classes.

<h2>Multiple Classes</h2>

If your child is interested in taking multiple classes during the same session, pay the first class in full and apply the code CURIOSITY50 for any other classes your student takes during the same session. 

This code does not apply to siblings. Classes must be attended by the same student.

<h2>Siblings discount</h2>

Pay for one child in full. For subsequent children, use the code SIBLINGS10.
