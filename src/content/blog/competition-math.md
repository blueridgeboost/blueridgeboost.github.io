        Your child will practice regularly during the regularly scheduled classes in preparation for five monthly Olympiad contests. Being able to solve a difficult problem is one of the most satisfying experiences one may have. On the other hand, struggling with a difficult problem should indicate to your child that they have found something worthwhile and new to learn. This should be viewed as a challenge and an opportunity to grow.
