      I am originally from Bucharest, Romania and earned a B.Sc. in Computer Science at the Polytechnical University of Bucharest. I moved to Charlottesville in the Fall of 2004 to pursue graduate school at the University of Virginia, where I earned a Master's in Computer Science, a Master of Science in Mathematics, and a Master of Teaching. Some of my accomplishments include:

      <h3>Ransford Dunu</h3>
      <p>I am originally from Koforidua, Ghana. I moved to Charlottesville, Virginia with my parents when I was 11 months old. I am currently working toward my Associate's Degree in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science.</p>
      <p>I have experience in teaching teens and kids how to code. Through NSBE(Nation Society of Black Engineers) and Mrs. Early from Albemarle High School I was able to teach middle schoolers how to code a Sphero to get out of a maze. During that time I helped the students to understand critical thinking and problem-solving skills to be able to guide the Sphero out of not just one maze but an array of mazes with the same code.</p>

      <h3>Lucy Berndt</h3>
      My name is Lucy Berndt and I am so excited to be joining the team at Blue Ridge Boost. With over 30 years of teaching and tutoring, I bring a lot of experience to the table. My undergraduate degree is from UVA where I earned a BS in Math Education. I am licensed to teach k-12 and believe it or not, I have taught in one form or another grades kindergarten to twelveth. <br>
I love working with children. I love seeing the light that goes on or the smile on their face when they get the concept. I particularly like tutoring because I know that I will make a difference in their lives. I try to make my tutoring session catered to the individual. I try very hard to make math not only understandable but fun.
