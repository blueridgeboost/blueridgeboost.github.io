      <h3>Ransford Dunu</h3>
      <b>Camp Coordinator. Coding and robotics teacher.</b><br>
      <p>I am originally from Koforidua, Ghana. I moved to Charlottesville, Virginia with my parents when I was 11 months old. I am currently working toward my Associate's Degree in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science.</p>
      <p>I have experience in teaching teens and kids how to code. Through NSBE(Nation Society of Black Engineers) and Mrs. Early from Albemarle High School I was able to teach middle schoolers how to code a Sphero to get out of a maze. During that time I helped the students to understand critical thinking and problem-solving skills to be able to guide the Sphero out of not just one maze but an array of mazes with the same code.</p>

      <h3>Scarlett Morse</h3>
      <b>Instructor Camp Ages 10 to 13.</b><br>
      <p>I have lived in Pennsylvania, Virginia, and France, and am currently a senior at Albemarle High School in the Math, Engineering, and Science Academy. Next year, I plan on going to either UVA or McGill to study math and computer science, environmental science, political science, and French. I run Mathemagicians, a math club at the Northside Library for teens interested in STEM, and did an internship at a pharmacy in Arzens, France working with a shelf-stocking robot. Whether tutoring peers and neighbors in math or tinkering with 3d printers and welding equipment, I love sharing my interest in technology and science with others!</p>

      <h3>Carter Earles</h3>
      <b>Instructor Camp Ages 10 to 13.</b><br>
      <p>I was born in Charlottesville and have lived here my entire life. I am a sophomore at Albemarle High School, and I also attend Center 1 for game design. (Center 1 is a small school where career-specific courses are taught.) At Albemarle, I play tenor saxophone in the marching band, jazz band, and sax choir. I am also a programmer at Cavelier Robotics and am in the Albemarle Key Club. Some of my greatest areas of interest are programming, game development, machine learning, and evolutionary algorithms. I also really enjoy math and how it is applied to describe various systems in nature. I also love sharing my passion for STEM through various events such as Girls Geek Day, STEM Night, and now, Blue Ridge Boost!</p>
