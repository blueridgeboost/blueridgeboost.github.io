I am originally from Bucharest, Romania and earned a B.S. in Computer Science at the Polytechnical University of Bucharest. I moved to Charlottesville in the Fall of 2004 to pursue graduate school at the University of Virginia, where she earned a Master's in Computer Science, a Master of Science in Mathematics, and a Master of Teaching. I have several years of experience as a software engineer and am the author of several research papers in Computer Science. I am passionate about Math education, especially for girls and women, and I co-founded a Math Circle for girls and held lessons for four years until the COVID-19 pandemic. In January 2021, I decided to focus full-time on education. After completing my Master of Teaching, I joined the teaching faculty at Peabody School for the 2022-2023 academic year where I taught Algebra 1 and Algebra 2 to academically advanced middle school students. Currently, I am focusing full-time on coding and math classes at Blue Ridge Boost, which I founded in November 2021.
