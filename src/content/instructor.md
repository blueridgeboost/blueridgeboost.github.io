      <h3>Nora Evans</h3>
      I am originally from Bucharest, Romania and earned a B.Sc. in Computer Science at the Polytechnical University of Bucharest. I moved to Charlottesville in the Fall of 2004 to pursue graduate school at the University of Virginia, where I earned a Master's in Computer Science, a Master of Science in Mathematics, and a Master of Teaching. Some of my accomplishments include:

* [co-author](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BTsjtmgAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) of several research articles
* several years of industry experience as a Java software developer
* over two years of online tutoring on [Wyzant](https://www.wyzant.com/Tutors/VA/Charlottesville/9957760/) in C, C++, Java, Python, List, and Prolog.
* teaching assistant at the University of Virginia 
* [First Lego League](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/fll/what-is-first-lego-league) team lead and coach

      <h3>Ransford Dunu</h3>
      <p>I am originally from Koforidua, Ghana. I moved to Charlottesville, Virginia with my parents when I was 11 months old. I am currently working toward my Associate's Degree in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science.</p>
      <p>I have experience in teaching teens and kids how to code. Through NSBE(Nation Society of Black Engineers) and Mrs. Early from Albemarle High School I was able to teach middle schoolers how to code a Sphero to get out of a maze. During that time I helped the students to understand critical thinking and problem-solving skills to be able to guide the Sphero out of not just one maze but an array of mazes with the same code.</p>

    <h3>Saumya Sharma</h3>
    <p>I am from NoVa  and am a current 3rd year at the University of Virginia working towards a degree in Global Public Health and a minor in Computer Science. As a member of the community, I have valued tutoring and working with students as a way to help bring the community forward by being involved in it. I was on a FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) robotics team for 3 years and have continued my appreciation for Computer Science during my time at UVA.</p>

      <h3>Jared Hull</h3>
      <p>My name is Jared, and I am currently attending PVCC. I plan on transferring to UVa to major in aerospace/mechanical engineering with a minor in computer science.<br>
      I have experience tutoring kids and teens since high school and have always taken pride in helping others in any subject, but mostly math and coding, whether it be C++, Java, or Python. I am great at helping students think critically and develop their problem-solving skills, which are quite important, especially for coding.</p>
