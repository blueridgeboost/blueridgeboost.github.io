      <h3>Ransford Dunu</h3>
      <p>I am originally from Koforidua, Ghana. I moved to Charlottesville, Virginia with my parents when I was 11 months old. I am currently working toward my Associate's Degree in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science.</p>
      <p>I have experience in teaching teens and kids how to code. Through NSBE(Nation Society of Black Engineers) and Mrs. Early from Albemarle High School I was able to teach middle schoolers how to code a Sphero to get out of a maze. During that time I helped the students to understand critical thinking and problem-solving skills to be able to guide the Sphero out of not just one maze but an array of mazes with the same code.</p>

    <h3>Saumya Sharma</h3>
    <p>I am from NoVa  and am a current 3rd year at the University of Virginia working towards a degree in Global Public Health and a minor in Computer Science. As a member of the community, I have valued tutoring and working with students as a way to help bring the community forward by being involved in it. I was on a FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) robotics team for 3 years and have continued my appreciation for Computer Science during my time at UVA.</p>
