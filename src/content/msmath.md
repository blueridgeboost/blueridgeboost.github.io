At Blue Ridge Boost, a qualified and experienced teacher assesses your student's knowledge and builds an **individualized instruction** plan that targets weak areas while assisting with topics the student is learning. 

#### Supplementing Classroom Instruction

The instructor will work with the classroom teacher when available to match the style of teaching and materials to maintain **consistency** in the style of presentation.
In a tutoring session, the instructor **reviews** concepts your student learned in class and **assists with homework**. If the student needs help with some problems, then the instructor proposes new problems for the student to solve independently.

When your student needs an alternate view of the topic or just wants to learn a topic not taught in class, our instructors create individualized lessons at the level needed by the student.


#### Teaching New Topics

Our instructors are qualified teachers with tutoring experience in middle school math, including algebra and geometry. We use a variety of texts and materials including the *Art of Problem Solving* curriculum and *All Things Algebra*.

Students learn math by solving increasingly difficult problems. In a tutoring session, the student is taught how to approach a problem through a series of questions or direct instruction. After that, the student is presented with a set of problems that are small variations of the original, which will be solved with the instructor's assistance when needed. Students gain confidence to approach problems never seen before.
