## Computing

At Blue Ridge Boost, we teach computing using play, starting with
robots to visualize the programming concepts. The programming
exercises use an attractive graphical interface to reinforce concepts
through practice.

We believe that students have to be exposed to the same programming
concepts in a variety of situations and language variations. For this
reason, students learn a few block languages to program WeDo Lego
robots, mBot robots, help a beaver build its house. Younger students
experiment with Makey Makey and Cubetto. Older students may use Python
to program the mBots.

## Math

At Blue Ridge Boost, we teach problem solving skills, rather than drill and memorization. For younger students, we offer math circle type classes, in which students solve challenging problems in groups.

We also teach pre-algebra, algebra, geometry, pre-calculus, and
calulus using the Art of Problem Solving textbooks, suplemented with
Desmos activities to build a visual intuition, feedback on written
solution to learn mathematical writing, and group work on performance
tasks where the students apply the material learned in a novel
situation.
