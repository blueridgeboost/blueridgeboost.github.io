#### Session 1. Sequencing, Objects, Loops and Variables 

In the first 8-week session students learn objects and properties, lists and indexing, for loops, variables, and conditional statements.<br>

**Lessons 1 and 2.** Basic coding <br>
Students learn that coding is giving precise instructions to a computer. Students learn the concept of object and learn that each object can perform several actions.

**Lessons 3 and 4.** Lists <br>
Students learn to create and manipulate lists, a fundamental concept in computing.

**Lessons 5 and 6.** Variables <br>
Students learn to create complex programs by storing intermediate computations into variables. 

**Lessons 7 and 8.** Conditionals <br>
Students learn to write programs whose execution depends on the truth value of variables.
