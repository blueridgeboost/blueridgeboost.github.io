During the COVID-19 pandemic, I spent significant time teaching and helping my children learn and discovered that I greatly enjoy teaching young students. Consequently, I quit a Ph.D. program in computer science to pursue a degree in teaching, which I completed in May 2022. 

During the lockdown, I tried with my children a variety of challenging and interesting classes, but however good the instructors were, they could not compensate for the lack of face-to-face interaction. I would like to offer an affordable in-person alternative to courses for advanced students that are ready for challeging content. I founded Blue Ridge Boost to offer year-round in-person high-quality education in math and coding. We started in 2021 with math and coding tutoring online in person from my home for advanced high school and college students. In 2022, Blue Ridge Boost expanded to offer in-person coding classes for elementary and middle school students at our Downtown office. 

Blue Ridge Boost is unique in that we offer affordable year-round high-quality coding and individual math and coding education. Our coding classes are teaching core coding concepts and are developed and selected by experienced educators and engineers. Our math classes focus on understanding and helping students become independent learners.

I envision Blue Ridge Boost as a place for bright students to thrive and achieve their potential.
