## History of Blue Ridge Boost
During the COVID-19 pandemic, I spent significant time teaching and helping my children learn and discovered that I greatly enjoy teaching young students. As a result, I quit my Ph.D. program in Computer Science to pursue a degree in teaching at the University of Virginia, which I completed in May 2022. 

During the lockdown, my children tried a variety of challenging and exciting classes. Still, however good the instructors were, they could not compensate for the lack of face-to-face interaction.

I wanted to offer an affordable in-person alternative to courses for advanced students ready for challenging content. So I founded Blue Ridge Boost to offer year-round in-person high-quality education in math and coding.

We started in 2021 with math and coding tutoring
online in person from my home for advanced high school and college
students. In 2022, Blue Ridge Boost expanded to offer in-person coding
classes for elementary and middle school students at our Downtown
office.

# Mission

Blue Ridge Boost is unique in offering affordable year-round, high-quality coding and individual math and coding education.

Our coding classes teach core coding concepts and are developed and
selected by experienced educators and engineers. Our math classes
focus on understanding and helping students become independent
learners.

I envision Blue Ridge Boost as a place for bright students to thrive
and achieve their potential.
