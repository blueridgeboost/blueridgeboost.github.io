        <p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, I spent a significant amount of time teaching and helping my children learn and discovered that I greatly enjoy teaching young students. As a result, I quit my Ph.D. program in Computer Science to pursue a degree in teaching at the University of Virginia and launched Blue Ridge Boost. </p>
        <p>During the lockdown, Maxwell and Dorina tried a variety of challenging and exciting classes from the <a href="https://cty.jhu.edu/">Center for Talented Youth at John Hopkins</a> and <a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/">The Art Of Problem Solving</a>. Still, however good the instructors were, they could not compensate for the lack of face-to-face interaction.</p>
        <p>I founded Blue Ridge Boost in 2021 as an affordable in-person alternative to online, expensive courses for advanced students ready for challenging content. I started Blue Ridge Boost with math and coding tutoring online and in person from my home for advanced high school and college students. After graduation, in 2022, I expanded Blue Ridge Boost to offer in-person coding classes for elementary and middle school students at the Downtown office. In June 2023, after a year as an Algebra teacher at the Peabody School, I decided to focus all my attention and energy on Blue Ridge Boost. I plan to expand our course offerings in the Fall 2023 to unplugged coding for preschoolers and additional tutoring hours for college students.

        <h2>Mission</h2>
        <p>Blue Ridge Boost is unique in offering affordable year-round, high-quality coding and individual math and coding education.</p>
        <p>Coding classes teach core coding concepts and are developed and selected by experienced educators and engineers. Math classes focus on understanding and helping students become independent learners.</p>
        <p>I envision Blue Ridge Boost as a place for bright students to thrive and achieve their potential.</p>
