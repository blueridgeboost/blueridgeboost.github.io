            <p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, I spent a significant amount of time teaching and helping my children learn and discovered that I greatly enjoy teaching young students. As a result, I quit my Ph.D. program in Computer Science to pursue a degree in teaching at the University of Virginia and launched Blue Ridge Boost. </p>
            <p>During the lockdown, Maxwell and Dorina tried a variety of challenging and exciting classes from the <a href="https://cty.jhu.edu/">Center for Talented Youth at John Hopkins</a> and <a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/">The Art Of Problem Solving</a>. Still, however good the instructors were, they could not compensate for the lack of face-to-face interaction.</p>
            <p>I founded Blue Ridge Boost in 2021 as an affordable in-person alternative to online, expensive courses for advanced students ready for challenging content. I started Blue Ridge Boost with math and coding tutoring online and in person from my home for advanced high school and college students. After graduation, in 2022, I expanded Blue Ridge Boost to offer in-person coding classes for elementary and middle school students at the Downtown office. In June 2023, after a year as an Algebra teacher at the Peabody School, I decided to focus all my attention and energy on Blue Ridge Boost. In 2023, we expanded the office and the course offerings to include math and robotics classes.

            <h2>Mission</h2>
            <p>Blue Ridge Boost stands out from other educational institutions because it provides affordable year-round education in coding and individual math instruction. This unique approach allows students to engage with these subjects consistently, fostering a deeper understanding and long-term skill development.</p><p>
            The coding classes offered by Blue Ridge Boost are meticulously designed to teach students core coding concepts. These classes are carefully developed and selected by experienced educators and engineers, ensuring that the curriculum is comprehensive, up-to-date, and aligned with industry standards. By learning fundamental coding concepts, students gain a solid foundation that can be applied to various programming languages and technologies. The expertise of the educators and engineers involved in creating these courses ensures that students receive high-quality instruction and practical, real-world knowledge.</p><p>
            In addition to coding education, Blue Ridge Boost places a strong emphasis on math instruction. The math classes provided by the institution focus on fostering a deep understanding of mathematical concepts rather than relying solely on rote memorization. This approach encourages students to think critically, solve problems creatively, and develop independent learning skills. By becoming independent learners, students are better equipped to tackle complex mathematical challenges and apply their knowledge in practical contexts.</p><p>
            Blue Ridge Boost goes beyond classroom instruction to support its community of learners. The institution hosts the Charlottesville Kids' Chess Club, providing a space for students to learn and enjoy the game of chess. Chess is known for its cognitive benefits, such as enhancing critical thinking, concentration, and strategic planning skills. By offering this club, Blue Ridge Boost promotes holistic development and encourages students to engage in activities that complement their academic pursuits.</p><p>
            Recognizing that financial constraints can hinder access to quality education, Blue Ridge Boost takes proactive steps to address this issue. The institution offers several scholarships to students with financial need, ensuring that deserving individuals have the opportunity to benefit from their educational programs. These scholarships open doors for talented students who might otherwise be unable to pursue coding and math education due to financial limitations. By providing financial assistance, Blue Ridge Boost demonstrates its commitment to inclusivity, equal opportunity, and empowering students from diverse backgrounds.</p><p>
            In summary, Blue Ridge Boost's unique attributes lie in its affordable year-round education in coding and individual math instruction. The institution's coding classes, created by experienced educators and engineers, teach core concepts and provide students with practical coding skills. The math instruction emphasizes understanding and independent learning. By hosting the Charlottesville Kids' Chess Club and offering scholarships to students with financial need, Blue Ridge Boost further enriches the educational experience and supports its community of learners.
