#### Get Ready for Math Analysis/Precalc! 

Join our summer classes in August, to participate in a carefully developed curriculum to review **Algebra 2 and Trigonometry** including quadratic, exponential, polynomial and trigonometric functions.

#### Precalc Remediation

The instructor will work with the classroom teacher when available to match the style of teaching and materials to maintain **consistency** in the style of presentation.
In a tutoring session, the instructor **reviews** concepts your student learned in class and assists with homework. If the student needs help with some problems, then the instructor proposes **new problems** for the student to solve independently.

When your student needs an alternate view of the topic or just wants to learn a topic not taught in class, our instructors create individualized lessons at the level needed by the student.

#### Precalc for Advanced Students

Our instructors are qualified teachers with tutoring experience in middle school math, including algebra and geometry. We use a variety of texts and materials including the *Art of Problem Solving* curriculum, and *Flamingo Math*.

Students are presented with challenging problems for a deeper understanding of the subject.
