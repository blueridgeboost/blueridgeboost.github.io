We help your child succeed in precalculus and teach advanced concepts to students that are ready for a challenging curriculum. Our services include an Algebra 2 review before school starts, ongoing support with classroom content, and new topics and lessons.

#### Get Ready for Math Analysis/Precalc! 

Join our summer classes in August to participate in a carefully developed curriculum to review **Algebra 2 and Trigonometry**, including quadratic, exponential, polynomial, and trigonometric functions.

#### Precalc Remediation

The instructor will work with the classroom teacher when available to match the teaching style and materials to maintain **consistency** in the presentation style. For example, in a tutoring session, the instructor **reviews** concepts your student learned in class and **assists with homework**. If the student needs extra practice, the instructor proposes new problems for the student to solve independently.

When your student needs an alternate view or wants to learn a topic not taught in class, our instructors create individualized lessons at the level the student needs.
