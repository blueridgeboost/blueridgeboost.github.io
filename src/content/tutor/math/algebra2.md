We help your child succeed in algebra and teach advanced concepts to students that are ready for a challenging curriculum. Our services include an Algebra 1 review before school starts, ongoing support with classroom content, and new topics and lessons.

<h2> Get Ready for Algebra 2! </h2>

Join our summer classes in August, to participate in a carefully developed curriculum to review Algebra 1, including linear functions, linear equations and systems of equations, exponent laws, quadratic functions, and polynomials.

<!-- <b>To secure your spot in one of our review sessions <a href="https://get-ready-for-the-next-school-year-with-math-reviews.cheddarup.com">signup here!</a></b>  -->


<h2> Algebra 2 Remediation </h2>
The instructor will work with the classroom teacher when available to match the teaching style and materials to maintain **consistency** in the presentation style. For example, in a tutoring session, the instructor **reviews** concepts your student learned in class and **assists with homework**. If the student needs more practice, the instructor proposes new problems for the student to solve independently.

When your student needs an alternate view or wants to learn a topic not taught in class, our instructors create individualized lessons at the level the student needs.

<h2> Algebra 2 for Advanced Students </h2>

We use a variety of texts and materials, including the *Art of Problem Solving*&reg; curriculum, *Big Ideas Math*&reg; textbooks, *All Things Algebra*&reg;, and *Flamingo Math*&reg;.

Students learn by solving challenging problems for a deeper understanding of the subject.
