We help your child succeed in algebra and teach advanced concepts to students that are ready for a challenging curriculum. Our services include a prealgebra review before school starts, ongoing support with classroom content, and new topics and lessons.

## Get Ready for Algebra 1! 

Join our summer classes in August to participate in a carefully developed curriculum to review pre-algebra, including fractions, ratios, proportions, order of operations, and exponents.

## Algebra 1 Remediation
The instructor will work with the classroom teacher when available to match the teaching style and materials to maintain **consistency** in the presentation style. For example, in a tutoring session, the instructor **reviews** concepts your student learned in class and assists with homework. If the student needs extra practice, the instructor proposes **new problems** for the student to solve independently.

When your student needs an alternate view or wants to learn a topic not taught in class, our instructors create individualized lessons at the level the student needs.
