## Get Ready for Algebra 1! 

 <!-- <a class="btn btn-contact-us" href="https://get-ready-for-the-next-school-year-with-math-reviews.cheddarup.com">Signup here</a> to join our summer classes in August to participate in a carefully developed curriculum to review pre-algebra. </br> -->

At Blue Ridge Boost, we strongly believe that math is not a spectator sport. Children learn math and become independent, confident mathematicians by solving a variety of problems. Our lessons are short and teach algebraic thinking rather than drill and kill. The problems are selected from a variety of sources, including <a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/teaching-learning-assessment/k-12-standards-instruction/mathematics/instructional-resources/algebra-readiness-initiative">VDOE Algebra Readiness Initiative, Khan Academy Get Ready for Algebra 1</a>, <a href="https://bim.easyaccessmaterials.com/protected/content/srh/hs/">Big Ideas Math HS Skills Review Handbook</a>, and <a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/store/book/prealgebra">Art of Problem Solving Prealgebra</a>.

Each day students solve problems from the following topics.

<b>Day 1: Number Sense.</b> Review negative numbers, decimals and fractions and order of operations with an emphasis on the properties of addition and multiplication. 

<b>Day 2: Linear relationships.</b> Students practice ratios, percentages and proportions problems, and learn to recognize and graph linear relationships. 

<b>Day 3: Patterns and functions.</b> Students practice pattern recognition and learn to distinguish between non-function and function relations.

<b>Day 4: Equations and inequalities.</b> Students practice solving linear equations and inequalities. 

<b>Day 5: Exponents and radicals.</b> Students review the laws of exponents and simplification of radicals.  


## Algebra 1 Remediation
The instructor will work with the classroom teacher when available to match the teaching style and materials to maintain **consistency** in the presentation style. For example, in a tutoring session, the instructor **reviews** concepts your student learned in class and assists with homework. If the student needs extra practice, the instructor proposes **new problems** for the student to solve independently.

When your student needs an alternate view or wants to learn a topic not taught in class, our instructors create individualized lessons at the level the student needs.
