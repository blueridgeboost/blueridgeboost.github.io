We help your child succeed in geometry and teach advanced concepts to students that are ready for a challenging curriculum. Our services include algebra and middle school geometry review before school starts, ongoing support with classroom content, and new topics and lessons.


<h2> Get Ready for Geometry </h2>

 <!-- <a class="btn btn-contact-us" href="https://get-ready-for-the-next-school-year-with-math-reviews.cheddarup.com">Signup here</a> to join our summer classes in August to participate in a carefully developed curriculum to review middle-school Geometry and Algebra 1. </br> -->

At Blue Ridge Boost, we strongly believe that math is not a spectator sport. Children learn math and become independent, confident mathematicians by solving a variety of problems. Our lessons are short and teach algebraic thinking rather than drill and kill. The problems are selected from a variety of sources, including <a href="https://bim.easyaccessmaterials.com/protected/content/srh/hs/">Big Ideas Math HS Skills Review Handbook</a> and <a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/store/book/intro-algebra">Art of Problem Solving Algebra</a>.

Each day students solve problems from the following topics.

<b>Day 1: Graphing Lines.</b> Students review the standard, point-slope and slope-intercept form of linear equations, graph lines given one point and slope and two points. 

<b>Day 2: Equations of perpendicular and parallel lines.</b> Students practice writing the equation of a line given a point and a slope, and two slops, including the equations of lines perpendicular or parallel lines to a given line. 

<b>Day 3: Solving linear equations and systems of equations.</b> Students practice combining like terms, solving multiple steps linear equations, and solving systems of linear equations graphically, by substitution and by elimination.

<b>Day 4: Radicals and quadratics equations.</b> Students review the simplification of radicals and practice polynomial multiplication, factoring quadratics, and solving quadratic equations using the quadratic formula.

<b>Day 5: Geometry.</b> Students review the definition and properties of parallel lines, mid-point formula, classification of polygons, and area and perimeter of shapes. 


<h2> Geometry Remediation </h2>
The instructor will work with the classroom teacher when available to match the teaching style and materials to maintain **consistency** in the presentation style. For example, in a tutoring session, the instructor **reviews** concepts your student learned in class and assists with homework. If the student needs extra practice, the instructor proposes **new problems** for the student to solve independently.

When your student needs an alternate view or wants to learn a topic not taught in class, our instructors create individualized lessons at the level the student needs.

<h2> Geometry for Advanced Students </h2>
Students ready for a more challenging curriculum are taught logic, proof-based, and Euclidean geometry.
