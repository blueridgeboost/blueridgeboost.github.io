We help your child succeed in algebra and teach advanced concepts to students that are ready for a challenging curriculum. Our services include algebra and middle school geometry review before school starts, ongoing support with classroom content, and new topics and lessons.


## Get Ready for Geometry

Join our Summer classes in August to participate in a carefully developed curriculum to review Algebra 1 topics, including linear equations, systems of linear equations, and the Pythagorean Theorem.

<b>To secure your spot in one of our review sessions <a href="https://get-ready-for-the-next-school-year-with-math-reviews.cheddarup.com">signup here!</a></b> 

## Geometry Remediation
The instructor will work with the classroom teacher when available to match the teaching style and materials to maintain **consistency** in the presentation style. For example, in a tutoring session, the instructor **reviews** concepts your student learned in class and assists with homework. If the student needs extra practice, the instructor proposes **new problems** for the student to solve independently.

When your student needs an alternate view or wants to learn a topic not taught in class, our instructors create individualized lessons at the level the student needs.

For more details on our services, <a href="/contact/"> fill out the contact form</a> or email  <a href="mailto:nora@blueridgeboost.com"><em>nora@blueridgeboost.com</em></a>. 

## Geometry for Advanced Students
Students ready for a more challenging curriculum are taught logic, proof-based, and Euclidean geometry.
