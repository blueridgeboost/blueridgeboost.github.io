#### Supplementing Classroom Instruction
The instructor will work with the classroom teacher when available to match the teaching style and materials to maintain **consistency** in the presentation style. For example, in a tutoring session, the instructor **reviews** concepts your student learned in class and **assists with homework**. If the student needs extra practice, the instructor proposes new problems for the student to solve independently.

When your student needs an alternate view or wants to learn a topic not taught in class, our instructors create individualized lessons at the level the student needs.


#### Teaching New Topics

Our instructors are qualified teachers with tutoring experience in middle school math, including algebra and geometry. We use a variety of texts and materials, including the _Art_ of Problem Solving* curriculum and *All Things Algebra*.

Students learn math by solving increasingly complex problems. In a tutoring session, the student learns how to approach a problem through questions or direct instruction. After that, the student solves problems that are variations of the original, which will be solved with the instructor's assistance when needed. As a result, students gain confidence to approach problems never seen before.
