                    In Space Race Camp, campers meet “VEX,” the 123 Robot through a fun and interactive story and establish a set of rules and practices for working with the robot. Then, campers imagine their robot as a Mars rover and complete several missions including coding their robot to collect samples and return them to base camp for delivering to Earth. Then, campers will use the Eye Sensor to detect objects and clear the landing area for future missions.<br>
                    In the afternoons, the campers use the Art Ring and craft materials to transform the Vex123 robot into a variety of animals.<br>

Perfect for middle and high school students, this summer camp runs for one action-packed quarter, offering 30 hours of hands-on, engaging learning experiences.<br>
                    🐶 Why Karel the Dog? 
                    Karel is not just any dog — he’s your gateway to the world of coding! In a fun, grid-based world, you’ll teach Karel to perform tasks, maneuver obstacles, and solve puzzles, all through programming.<br>
                    🖥️ Learn to Code in JavaScript:
                    No previous experience? No problem! You’ll start from the basics, learning to issue commands and use functions in JavaScript, the language of the web. You’ll write both text-based and block-based programs right in your browser using the CodeHS online editor.
